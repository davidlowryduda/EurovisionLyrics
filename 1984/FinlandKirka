The last train left at 22.45, but who cares<br />
At 5.30 in the morning from track 2<br />
Another train&#8217;s going to leave</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just hang around tonight<br />
And not sleep at all<br />
At the station we&#8217;ll play and swing around<br />
While we wait for the train</p>
<p>The last train took my bag away<br />
The trains are busy, not me, no way!<br />
You can catch the train of life anytime!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 2 a.m.<br />
And we&#8217;re all alone at the station<br />
We&#8217;ve been playing blues an hour or two<br />
And it&#8217;s still an eternity till morning</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just hang around tonight<br />
And not sleep at all<br />
At the station we&#8217;ll play and swing around<br />
While we wait for the train</p>
<p>The last train took my bag away<br />
The trains are busy, not me, no way!<br />
You can expand the concept of the world in other ways too</p>
<p>Track 2 it&#8217;s morning<br />
We&#8217;re late again it&#8217;s six o&#8217;clock<br />
As our trip moves further, our mood just goes on</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just hang around all day<br />
We&#8217;ll just play and swing around all day</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just hang around all day<br />
And not sleep at all<br />
Let&#8217;s just play and swing around all day<br />
While we wait for the train<br />
While we wait for the train<br />
