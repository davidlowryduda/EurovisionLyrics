<p>Long distance USA, last night I heard him say<br />
He&#8217;s been away too long, now he&#8217;s coming home<br />
Be on the morning plane, if I still feel the same<br />
I should be waiting &#8217;cause he&#8217;d be all alone</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in Arrivals by the time he had said<br />
I search the information board and it read<br />
&#8220;Terminal Three: flight&#8217;s on time&#8221;</p>
<p>Staring into a space, searching through every face<br />
He&#8217;s been away too long now, he must have changed<br />
Another time and place can never quite erase<br />
The way he turned his back and walked away</p>
<p>I repeated all the words he had said<br />
Until a voice came through into my head<br />
&#8220;Terminal Three: flight&#8217;s on time&#8221;</p>
<p>Fly to me on the wings of all you meant to me<br />
Memories of the dreams that all tomorrow can be<br />
For you and me<br />

<p>Long distance USA, last night I heard him say<br />
Could I be waiting &#8217;cause he&#8217;d be all alone<br />
I told him nothing&#8217;s changed and I still feel the same<br />
He&#8217;s been away too long</p>
<p>Come on home (Long distance USA, last night I heard him say)<br />
Come on home (Could I be waiting &#8217;cause he&#8217;d be all alone)<br />
Come on home (I told him nothing&#8217;s changed and I still feel the same)<br />
Come on home (He&#8217;s been away too long)<br />
&#8220;Terminal Three: flight&#8217;s on time&#8221;</p>
<p>Long distance USA, long distance USA<br />
Long distance USA, long distance USA<br />
Long distance USA, long distance USA<br />
Long distance USA, long distance USA</p>
