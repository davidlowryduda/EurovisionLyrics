I love you, only you<br />
I can&#8217;t live in a world without you<br />
Wherever I am I hear your voice<br />
I can&#8217;t forget you just like that</p>
<p>Take me in your arms again, let me warm your heart<br />
I want to give you everything, I love you so much</p>
<p>You belong to me, only to me<br />
Those are the words you once said to me<br />
I&#8217;m so alone, where do I have to go?<br />
Where are the good old days gone to?</p>
<p>Take me in your arms again, let me warm your heart<br />
I want to give you everything, I love you so much</p>
<p>I love you, only you<br />
I can&#8217;t live in a world without you<br />
I love you<br />
