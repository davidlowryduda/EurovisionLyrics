Long live life, we never know where we will end up<br />
Long live the belief in a life</p>
<p>Heaven and hell above us all<br />
Nobody understands, everybody knows, nobody sees<br />
How many more martyrs has to fall<br />
Before we have to see what is happening?</p>
<p>Long live life, we never know where we will end up<br />
Long live hope, we stand together no matter what happens<br />
Long live the belief that enemies can become friends<br />
Long live the belief in a life</p>
<p>Nobody understands that it affects all of us<br />
Nobody understands how this can happen<br />
Weapons become warm while bodies become cold<br />
All fighting all, though nobody is participating</p>
<p>Long live life, we never know where we will end up<br />
Long live hope, we stand together no matter what happens<br />
Long live the belief that enemies can become friends<br />
Long live the belief in a life<br />
(No matter what happens, what happens)</p>
<p>Long live life, we never know where we will end up<br />
Long live hope, we stand together no matter what happens<br />
Long live the belief that enemies can become friends<br />
Long live the faith in a life, no matter what happens</p>
<p>Long live life, w e never know where we will end up<br />
Long live&#8230;<br />
