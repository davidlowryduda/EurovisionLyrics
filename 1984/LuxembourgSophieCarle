There are sighs on the telephone<br />
Which prevent us from sleeping<br />
On my radio there are too many songs<br />
Which make my heart like a ragged doll</p>
<p>Above towns there are airplanes<br />
And stars which turn around<br />
Where are the horses of the merry-go-round?<br />
Where are the gods who protect us?</p>
<p>Give me hundred percent of love<br />
To share it every day<br />
With the sky, with the people, oh&#8230;<br />
Give me hundred percent of love</p>
<p>I would like to do something<br />
With blue, with pink<br />
To change the eyes of the earth<br />
Which look at films in reverse</p>
<p>I imagine a video clip<br />
In which children speak to birds<br />
We have sound without pictures<br />
We have the sea, but not the beach</p>
<p>Give me hundred percent of love<br />
To share it every day<br />
With the sky, with the people, oh&#8230;<br />
Give me hundred percent of love</p>
<p>If you have in your hands<br />
Old dreams that are useless</p>
<p>Give me hundred percent of love<br />
To share it every day<br />
With the sky, with the people, oh&#8230;<br />
Give me hundred percent of love</p>
<p>Give me hundred percent of love<br />
To share it every day<br />
With the sky, with the people, oh&#8230;<br />
Give me hundred percent of love<br />
