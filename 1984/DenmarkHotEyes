The rain is beating on the window<br />
I stare at it drearily<br />
There isn&#8217;t a lot, that indicates<br />
That the sun will come out again</p>
<p>Then the doorbell rings<br />
And who do you think steps in?<br />
You do, and at once the rain is gone<br />
At least in my mind</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
That&#8217;s just what makes me live<br />
The big sensation, a wonderful gift<br />
That suddenly appears out of nowhere</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
That&#8217;s just what makes me float through the air<br />
And if I dream, I beg you:<br />
Don&#8217;t wake me up anymore</p>
<p>You stand a bit shy and hesitate<br />
Then at last tells me<br />
That you&#8217;ve realized<br />
What I&#8217;ve known for so long</p>
<p>You stare past me, frightened<br />
At the word &#8216;love&#8217;<br />
Calm down, I&#8217;ll never get tired<br />
Of that word, you know</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
That&#8217;s just what makes me live<br />
The big sensation, a wonderful gift<br />
That suddenly appears out of nowhere</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
That&#8217;s just what makes me float through the air<br />
And if I dream, I beg you:<br />
Don&#8217;t wake me up anymore</p>
<p>We run down the street hand in hand<br />
And don&#8217;t care if the rain increases<br />
I get a bit proud and shy<br />
Every time you send me a smile</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just it&#8230;<br />
That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
That&#8217;s just what makes me live<br />
The big sensation, a wonderful gift<br />
That suddenly appears out of nowhere</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
That&#8217;s just what makes me float through the air<br />
And if I dream, I beg you:<br />
Don&#8217;t wake me up anymore<br />
