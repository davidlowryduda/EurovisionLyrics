Do you recall the snow falling that night?<br />
We were alone at the train station<br />
You were holding my hand<br />
Touching my hair and were quiet</p>
<p>You had to go with the first train, I know<br />
I saw fire in your eyes<br />
You whispered my name<br />
You were shaking from cold and crying</p>
<p>Bye love, bye love<br />
Bye love, bye and write me</p>
<p>Go on, don&#8217;t turn around<br />
You know it&#8217;s not important anymore<br />
Your eyes are telling me everything<br />
Just kiss me<br />
Bye love (Bye love)</p>
<p>(Bye love, bye love)</p>
