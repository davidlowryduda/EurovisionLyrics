<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
In the frontier villages they watch the trains passing<br />
The deserted roads of Tozeur</p>
<p>From a distant house, your mother sees me<br />
And she remembers me for my habits</p>
<p>And for a moment returns my desire<br />
Of living at a different pace<br />
Still the trains for Tozeur are passing by slowly</p>
<p>In the abandoned churches, they prepare shelters<br />
And new spaceships for journeys among the stars</p>
<p>In an old empty mine, the salt extends<br />
And I seem to remember it, like a dream</p>
<p>And for a moment returns my desire<br />
Of living at a different pace<br />
Still the trains for Tozeur are passing by slowly</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230;<br />
Dai daba daba da&#8230;<br />
Nanai na nana nanana nana&#8230;<br />
Nana dabai da nana&#8230;</p>
<p>Still we want to show him to you<br />
And you will&#8230;</p>
<p>In the frontier villages, they watch<br />
The trains passing by for Tozeur<br />
