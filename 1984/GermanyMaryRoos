So goodbye now, I won&#8217;t make a scene<br />
Turn around and go, I don&#8217;t need your compassion<br />
Perhaps I&#8217;m in despair, perhaps I feel bad<br />
But you will see, now, more than ever, I want to</p>
<p>Walk tall, walk tall<br />
At last I&#8217;ve learnt to stand up when I fall<br />
With proud in my eyes and in spite of tears in my face<br />
Walk tall through the night into the light</p>
<p>When you come back, I know, it should be soon<br />
It will be quite in vain, I&#8217;m not waiting for you<br />
And when we will meet, I will hardly look at you<br />
But when I will become weak, I say strictly to myself</p>
<p>Walk tall, walk tall<br />
At last I&#8217;ve learnt to stand up when I fall<br />
With proud in my eyes and in spite of tears in my face<br />
I go upright through the night into the light</p>
<p>Still my silence is somewhat bitter<br />
And my laughing still sounds a bit shrill<br />
There are still some splinters in my soul<br />
I still can&#8217;t see my aim, but I will</p>
<p>Walk tall, walk tall<br />
At last I&#8217;ve learnt to stand up when I fall<br />
With pride in my eyes and in spite of tears in my face<br />
Walk tall through the night into the light<br />
