Sometimes it&#8217;s in the midst of silence<br />
I find love in the look of your eyes<br />
It&#8217;s a stone, it&#8217;s a shout<br />
Born anywhere</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s in the midst of so many people<br />
I find at last what I am<br />
I&#8217;m a shout or I&#8217;m a stone<br />
From a place where I&#8217;m not</p>
<p>Sometimes I&#8217;m the time running slowly<br />
And what no one wants to believe<br />
Sometimes I&#8217;m also a happy yes or a sad no<br />
And I give my life for a day of illusion<br />
And I give my life for a day of illusion</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s in the midst of silence<br />
I find the words to say<br />
It&#8217;s a stone or it&#8217;s a shout<br />
Of a love yet to happen</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s in the midst of so many people<br />
I find at last where I&#8217;m going<br />
And this stone, and this shout<br />
Are the story of what I am</p>
<p>Sometimes I&#8217;m the time running slowly<br />
And what no one wants to believe<br />
Sometimes I&#8217;m also a happy yes or a sad no<br />
And I give my life for a day of illusion<br />
And I give my life for a day of illusion</p>
<p>Sometimes I&#8217;m the time running slowly<br />
And what no one wants to believe<br />
Sometimes I&#8217;m also a happy yes or a sad no<br />
And I give my life for a day of illusion<br />
And I give my life for a day of illusion<br />
