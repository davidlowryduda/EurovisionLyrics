The ground will tremble, fellows, when the halay is danced<br />
We love in a different way<br />
We are exuberant like torrents, like gusting winds<br />
We don&#8217;t look upon foreigners as strangers</p>
<p>Let blooms blossom on the bough<br />
We have so many beautiful things<br />
Let&#8217;s sing old love songs<br />
To the whole world</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s sing old love songs<br />
To the whole world</p>
<p>Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay<br />
With affection, we play and dance the halay</p>
<p>Let everyone take a place on this floor<br />
Let drums beat and rejoice<br />
Let the troubadour strike the strings of his lute<br />
So lovely is this tune</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s weave a web of friendship<br />
Let&#8217;s cross over those unyielding mountains<br />
Let&#8217;s sing old love songs<br />
To the whole world</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s sing old love songs<br />
To the whole world</p>
<p>Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay<br />
With affection, we play and dance the halay</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s weave a web of friendship<br />
Let&#8217;s cross over those unyielding mountains<br />
Let&#8217;s sing old love songs<br />
To the whole world</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s sing old love songs<br />
To the whole world</p>
<p>Hand in hand, we play and dance the halay<br />
With affection, we play and dance the halay</p>
<p>Halay<br />
