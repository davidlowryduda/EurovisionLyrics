Even when I was a little child, I thought about<br />
How to paint a picture of the world<br />
And who knows how a painter can do it?</p>
<p>Colourful and beautiful, full of sunshine<br />
That&#8217;s how I saw every day, but only at night<br />
The same question always crossed my mind</p>
<p>What colour is the sunshine?<br />
What colour is the world?<br />
Is it blue like the open sea?<br />
Like the sky above?</p>
<p>What colour is the sunshine?<br />
It casts shadow or light<br />
Look at the world with open eyes<br />
Or you won&#8217;t see the wonders</p>
<p>How to paint luck? Simply in fine red?<br />
How to paint pain? What colour is war?<br />
How to paint hunger and misery?</p>
<p>What colour is the sunshine?<br />
What colour is the world?<br />
Is it blue like the open sea?<br />
Like the sky above?</p>
<p>What colour is the sunshine?<br />
There are many coloured pictures<br />
The way you see things on earth<br />
It depends only on your feelings<br />
