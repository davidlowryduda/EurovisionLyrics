Which is the right side? Which is the wrong side?<br />
In which direction does the earth turn?<br />
It seems there&#8217;s something in the air</p>
<p>Is the world better or worse?<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I can say<br />
But at home, I hear laughter</p>
<p>There are as many lovers as stars in the sky<br />
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun<br />
Let me look at the future through your eyes<br />
Let me swear to you that we will stay together</p>
<p>There are as many lovers as stars in the sky<br />
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun<br />
If you know how to listen, you&#8217;ll hear birds<br />
If you know how to look, you&#8217;ll see, the world is beautiful<br />
The world is beautiful</p>
<p>Which is the wrong side? Which is the right side?<br />
In your arms, I don&#8217;t know it<br />
But nevertheless, we&#8217;re happy this way</p>
<p>If I must suffer, if I must die<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t mind dying of pleasure<br />
Of crazy love or of great laughter</p>
<p>There are as many lovers as stars in the sky<br />
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun<br />
Let me look at the future through your eyes<br />
Let me swear to you that we will stay together</p>
<p>There are as many lovers as stars in the sky<br />
There are as many lucky people as we under the sun<br />
If you know how to listen, you&#8217;ll hear the birds<br />
If you know how to look, you&#8217;ll see, the world is beautiful<br />
The world is beautiful<br />
