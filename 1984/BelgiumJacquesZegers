A lot of bends are often waiting for you</p>
<p>Go forward, go forward in life<br />

You would perish, go forward<br />
All the liberties growl on you</p>

Make the most of it, change your mind</p>

Help yourself, heaven will help you<br />
Stand up and walk, go forward<br />
Aomeone else said it before me</p>

(Remember the history of mankind) Heart and fists, go forward<br />
(Heart and fists, go forward)<br />
Maybe you will revive Rome<br />
