It simply was time to get away<br />
At last out from the daily grind, from the city, by morning dawn<br />
It was not your blame, it just was there<br />
And I&#8217;m not worried about it, and I didn&#8217;t regret, what happened</p>
<p>Simply gone with two suitcases into a different land<br />
Simply gone from home, or I will lose my mind<br />
Just get away, don&#8217;t care what the others will say<br />
Just get away, without asking you or anybody else</p>
<p>Devil take the hindmost<br />
I simply have to go<br />
I&#8217;m back to square one<br />
I can&#8217;t stand it anymore</p>
<p>I have already thought, it would be too late<br />
The feeling, when everything gets on your nerves<br />
A bit alone, but free<br />
And you get on the train, and everything is the same for you</p>
<p>Simply gone with two suitcases into a different land<br />
Simply gone from home, or I will lose my mind</p>
<p>Devil take the hindmost<br />
I simply have to go<br />
I&#8217;m back to square one<br />
I can&#8217;t stand it anymore</p>
<p>Simply gone with two suitcases, and then gone anywhere<br />
Just get away, though I will soon come back to you<br />
Simply gone with two suitcases, and then gone anywhere<br />
Just get away, though I will soon come back to you<br />
