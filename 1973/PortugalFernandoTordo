<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
It doesn&#8217;t matter, sun or shade<br />
Cabins or barriers<br />
We fight the beasts shoulder to shoulder</p>
<p>Nobody deceives us<br />
We fight hand in hand<br />
Only waiting can hurt us</p>
<p>Bells, cowbells and capes are coming in<br />
And black mantillas<br />
Swords, big horns and defeats are coming in<br />
And some poets</p>
<p>Brave people, carnations and swear words are coming in<br />
Because it&#8217;s a wheeze at most</p>
<p>Cows are coming in behind the forcados<br />
Who don&#8217;t fit at all<br />
Bravos and ol√©s of the yokels<br />
Who pay nothing are sounding</p>
<p>And only the bullfighter&#8217;s helpers are left<br />
Whose job doesn&#8217;t fit</p>
<p>With hopeful banderillas<br />
We keep off the beast<br />
We&#8217;re on the Spring Bullring</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to grab the world<br />
By the horns of misfortune<br />
And let&#8217;s make fun of sadness</p>
<p>Old women, crazy women and tourists are coming in<br />
Excursions are coming in<br />
Benefits and columnists are coming in<br />
Swappers are coming in</p>
<p>Marialvas and choristers are coming in<br />
Cockies with combs are coming in</p>
<p>Knights are coming in with a gallop<br />
Of their heroism<br />
That crazy music is coming in<br />
Called Paso Doble</p>
<p>The fan and the old-fashioned are coming in<br />
The snobbery and the hate too</p>
<p>Moralistic business people are coming in<br />
Frustrations are coming in<br />
Antiquaries and fado singers are coming in<br />
And contradictions</p>
<p>A lot of dollars are coming in, many people<br />
Who pay their millions</p>
<p>And the intelligent man says that songs are over</p>
<p>Lalalala lala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230; la la&#8230;</p>
<p>Lalalala lala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230; la la&#8230;<br />
