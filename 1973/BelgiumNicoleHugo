Nai nanana&#8230; nanana na nana&#8230;<br />
Oh&#8230; na nanana&#8230; nanana na nana&#8230;<br />
Lala lala la&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Baby, baby</em> – what&#8217;s the matter now?<br />
Just tell me, am I yours?<br />
Tell me for another thousand times<br />
Talk about love in every language</p>
<p>Love is fragile, it&#8217;s just like china<br />
Oh&#8230; breaks in your hand before it can be finished<br />
Let&#8217;s be together</p>
<p><em>Baby, baby, I love you</em><br />
I love you, yes, my love<br />
It&#8217;s so lovely to be together<br />
But the divorce doesn&#8217;t hurt after all</p>
<p>Though, I know, a woman can&#8217;t do anything alone<br />
Oh&#8230; love only happens together with two<br />
Let&#8217;s be together</p>
<p>Sometimes love is nothing but a sore<br />
Although you wanted that it could be different</p>
<p><em>Baby, baby</em> – what&#8217;s the matter now?<br />
Just tell me, am I yours?<br />
Tell me for another thousand times<br />
Talk about love in every language</p>
<p><em>Baby, baby, I love you</em><br />
I love you, yes, my love<br />
It&#8217;s so lovely to be together<br />
But the divorce doesn&#8217;t hurt after all</p>
<p>Nai nanana&#8230; nanana na nana&#8230;<br />
Oh&#8230; na nanana&#8230; nanana na nana&#8230;<br />
Lala lala la&#8230;<br />
