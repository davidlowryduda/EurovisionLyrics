<p>Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom<br />
I hear the music<br />
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom<br />
That&#8217;s how it goes</p>
<p>Music wakes me up every morning<br />
Skylight seem to bring on the sun<br />
Bluebirds chase my blues with the dawning<br />
I don&#8217;t mind the work to be done</p>
<p>Your smile makes my life worth the living<br />
And tells me how lucky I am<br />
To share in the love you are giving<br />
Every day, in every way</p>
<p>Every city sound has a rhythm<br />
Rhythm with the beat of my heart<br />
Begging me to sing along with him<br />
Telling me to give love a start</p>
<p>Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom<br />
I hear the music<br />
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom<br />
That&#8217;s how it goes</p>
<p>All day long, the hurry and scurry<br />
Tangled is the web that we weave<br />
Let the others whisper and worry<br />
As for me, my heart&#8217;s on my sleeve</p>
<p>Your smile makes my life worth the living<br />
And tells me how lucky I am<br />
To share in the love you are giving<br />
Every day, in every way</p>
<p>Nightingales all welcome the nighttime<br />
Soothing me to sleep with their song<br />
Your love came along at the right time<br />
Love that keeps me singing along</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom<br />
I hear the music<br />
Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom Tom<br />
That&#8217;s how it goes</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;<br />
Tra la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
Ra la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
Ra la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
Ra la la la la la la la&#8230;</p>
<p>Your smile makes my life worth the living<br />
And tells me how lucky I am<br />
To share in the love you are giving<br />
Every day, in every way</p>
<p>Nightingales all welcome the nighttime<br />
Soothing me to sleep with their song<br />
Your love came along at the right time<br />
Love that keeps me singing along<br />
It&#8217;s love that keeps me singing along</p>
