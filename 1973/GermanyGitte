The darkness with its worries<br />
Escapes from the day to the stars above<br />
The first light calls out for the morning<br />
And the sun rises</p>
<p>Young day, I ask you<br />
What is your gift to me?<br />
Are you bringing back tears from yesterday<br />
Or new love and new happiness?</p>
<p>Turn around and show your face<br />
Young day, don&#8217;t let me down</p>
<p>Dreams are flying through time and space<br />
And are still fighting the shadows of the night<br />
But sunlight falls through the trees<br />
And the earth awakes</p>
<p>Young day, I ask you<br />
What is your gift to me?<br />
Are you bringing back tears from yesterday<br />
Or new love and new happiness?</p>
<p>Turn around and show your face<br />
Young day, don&#8217;t let me down</p>
<p>New day (New day)<br />
What brings the wind (What brings the wind)<br />
When a new light begins?<br />
Is he bringing back tears from yesterday<br />
Or new love and new happiness?</p>
<p>I ask you, please tell it to me<br />
Young day, then I&#8217;ll trust you<br />
Young day, then I&#8217;ll trust you<br />
Young day, then I&#8217;ll trust you<br />
