<p>The middle of the night has come and I am awake<br />
Dreams come to the threshold<br />
It&#8217;s the silence before the storm<br />
Let&#8217;s go now</p>
<p>There &#8211; there I saw a rainbow<br />
There &#8211; there the morning rises in white<br />
Somewhere &#8211; there we&#8217;ll find the garden together<br />
The garden of love</p>
<p>There – there I heard an sweet old melody<br />
There – there is a moon every night<br />
There – there we&#8217;ll find the garden together<br />
The garden of love</p>
<p>Tonight my house is wrapped by the winds<br />
Holding it from every side<br />
We fly beyond the clouds<br />
Hand holding hand</p>
<p>Tonight a new day is knocking at my heart<br />
And you are drawing nearer with it<br />
Together we&#8217;ll ask for the azure gardens<br />
We&#8217;ll come to their gates</p>
<p>There &#8211; there I saw a rainbow<br />
There &#8211; there the morning rises in white<br />
Somewhere &#8211; there we&#8217;ll find the garden together<br />
The garden of love</p>
<p>There &#8211; there we&#8217;ll find the garden together<br />
The garden of love<br />
