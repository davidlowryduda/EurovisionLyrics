Like a promise, you are, you are<br />
Like a summer morning<br />
Like a smile, you are, you are<br />
Like that, like that, you are</p>
<p>All my hope, you are, you are<br />
Like fresh rain in my hands<br />
Like a strong breeze, you are, you are<br />
Like that, like that, you are</p>
<p>You are like the water of my fountain<br />
You are the fire of my hearth</p>
<p>(You are&#8230;) Something like that you are<br />
(Like the fire of my bonfire)<br />
Something like the fire of my bonfire</p>
<p>(You are&#8230;) Something like that you are<br />
(The wheat of my bread)<br />
My life, something like that, you are</p>
<p>Like my poem, you are, you are<br />
Like a guitar in the night<br />
My whole horizon, you are, you are<br />
Like that, like that, you are</p>
<p>(Nananana&#8230; nananana na&#8230;)</p>
<p>You are like the water of my fountain<br />
You are the fire of my hearth</p>
<p>(You are&#8230;) Something like that you are<br />
(Like the fire of my bonfire)<br />
Something like the fire of my bonfire</p>
<p>(You are&#8230;) Something like that you are<br />
(The wheat of my bread)<br />
My life, something like that, you are</p>
<p>(You are&#8230;) Something like that you are<br />
(Like the water of my fountain)<br />
Something like the water of my fountain<br />
You are the fire of my hearth<br />
