A train ticket crumpled in a pocket<br />
With, in a hand, a pocketbook<br />
She&#8217;s only eighteen years old, a big suitcase<br />
Blue eyes looking at a train that arrives</p>
<p>A train that leaves is a bit like a home<br />
A train that leaves<br />
For the one who never knew a home<br />
A train that leaves</p>
<p>A train that leaves is a bit like a song<br />
A train that leaves<br />
For the one who doesn&#8217;t hear songs being sung<br />
At the departure</p>
<p>The train scours the countryside, taking her to Paris<br />
What could she do there to gain her livelihood?<br />
She doesn&#8217;t know many things, she&#8217;s never done anything<br />
Other than leaving those that she loved</p>
<p>A train that leaves is a bit like a home<br />
A train that leaves<br />
For the one who never knew a home<br />
A train that leaves</p>
<p>A train that leaves is a bit like a song<br />
A train that leaves<br />
For the one who doesn&#8217;t hear songs being sung<br />
At the departure</p>
<p>A train that leaves is also the train of hope<br />
A train that leaves<br />
For the one who&#8217;s going to find the other<br />
Who is waiting in front of the station</p>
<p>A train that leaves is a bit like their song<br />
A train that leaves<br />
Where everything ends and starts, like a romance<br />
In a station<br />
