<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
In the dreams of childhood<br />
In the student that the teacher has punished<br />
In the train station where<br />
The first adventure of life begins</p>
<p>In the one who doubts<br />
In the one who believes</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll recognise yourself<br />
At every moment in each joy, in each tear<br />
You&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll recognise yourself<br />
In that child, surrounded by those people, just like you</p>
<p>In the dreams of the artist<br />
That glory has never awarded<br />
In that egoistic world<br />
That denies what it has loved</p>
<p>In those who are scared<br />
In those who are cold</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll recognise yourself<br />
At every moment in every joy, in every tear<br />
You&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll recognise yourself<br />
In that child, surrounded by those people, just like you</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll recognise yourself<br />
In that love that I have for you<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll recognise yourself<br />
