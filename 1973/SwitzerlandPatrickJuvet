My friends, my good friends, I&#8217;ve got you together<br />
We&#8217;re going to drown ourselves in champagne and whisky<br />
Go like a spinning top</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll laugh and sing the whole night long<br />
And then, tomorrow morning, I&#8217;ll go to the town hall<br />
Go like a spinning top, go like a spinning top</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to marry, Marie<br />
And say goodbye to Sophie, Marianne and Virginie<br />
Oh, don&#8217;t cry, Marie<br />
Not more than you, Véronica and Rebecca<br />
I renounce your caresses, your love, my sweet life</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to marry, Roger<br />
And say goodbye to you, Frédéric and you, Didier<br />
Don&#8217;t make fun, Lucas<br />
Not more than you, Napoléon, nor you, Colas</p>
<p>I renounce our feats, our crazy nights<br />
And our youth which finishes today<br />
Because I&#8217;m getting married</p>
<p>Tomorrow it&#8217;ll be good time to think about life<br />
To make children, to invest my savings<br />
Go like a spinning top</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be in prison, you won&#8217;t see me anymore<br />
Let&#8217;s drink on my health and for my lost freedom<br />
Long live the bride, long live the bride</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to marry, Marie<br />
And say goodbye to Sophie, Marianne and Virginie<br />
Oh, don&#8217;t cry, Marie<br />
Not more than you, Véronica and Rebecca<br />
I renounce your caresses, your love, my sweet life</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to marry, Roger<br />
And say goodbye to you, Frédéric and you, Didier<br />
Don&#8217;t make fun, Lucas<br />
Not more than you, Napoléon, nor you, Colas</p>
<p>We have to remember that until the end of our life<br />
And whatever may happen, we will remain friends<br />
Even if I&#8217;m getting married</p>
<p>Nana nana na&#8230; nana&#8230; nanana nananana nana nanana&#8230;<br />
Nana nana na&#8230; nana&#8230; nanana nananana nana nanana&#8230;<br />
Na na nana na na&#8230;<br />
Na na nana na na&#8230;</p>
<p>Nana nana na&#8230; nana&#8230; nanana nananana nana nanana&#8230;<br />
Nana nana na&#8230; nana&#8230; nanana nananana nana nanana&#8230;<br />
