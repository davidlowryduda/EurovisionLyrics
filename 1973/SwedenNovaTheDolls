<p>Monday morning &#8211; the streets are black with rain<br />
Under a skylight hovers sad and grey<br />
Tuesday waits down the endless dreary lane<br />
And every day is like the other day</p>
<p>I am blue and I long for your caress<br />
Oh, your breasts are like swallows a-nestling</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the summer, life grows in you<br />
Summer wind blows in you<br />
Summer rains flow in you<br />
Summer sings low in you<br />
You are summer, you never tell me no</p>
<p>Summer, life grows in you<br />
Summer wind blows in you<br />
Summer, you never tell me no</p>
<p>Times are stale and the days are long and slow<br />
There is no song can make me laugh and sing<br />
Half past four, I pack up and home I go<br />
Home to the void and fear the evenings bring</p>
<p>I am blue and I long for your caress<br />
Oh, your breasts are like swallows a-nestling</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the summer, life grows in you<br />
Summer wind blows in you<br />
Summer rains flow in you<br />
Summer sings low in you<br />
You are summer, you never tell me no</p>
<p>Summer, life grows in you<br />
Summer wind blows in you<br />
Summer, you never tell me no</p>
<p>I am blue and I long for your caress<br />
Oh, your breasts are like swallows a-nestling</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the summer, life grows in you<br />
Summer wind blows in you<br />
Summer rains flow in you<br />
Summer sings low in you<br />
You are summer, you never tell me no</p>
<p>You are summer, you never tell me no</p>
