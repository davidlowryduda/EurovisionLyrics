<p>Does the sun dance on the river?<br />
Does it sparkle? Does it quiver? Do I dream?<br />
Are the mountains blue and hazy<br />
Or am I a little crazy? Do I dream?</p>
<p>My darling, tell me, do your arms enfold me?<br />
Did you say you love me only?<br />
Is it true, or am I in a dream?</p>
<p>Has this cloud a silver lining?<br />
Will the sun be always shining?<br />
Darling, do I dream?</p>
<p>Are we walking through the heather?<br />
Are we holding hands together? Do I dream?<br />
Are there many coloured flowers?<br />
Have we loved away the hours? Do I dream?</p>
<p>My darling, if I&#8217;m dreaming, do not wake me<br />
Never let my dream forsake me<br />
I love you and that is not a dream</p>
<p>Will this love go on forever?<br />
Could we share our life together?<br />
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?</p>
<p>Is the moon a little brighter?<br />
Are my footsteps feeling lighter? Do I dream?<br />
Are there lucky stars above me?<br />
Tell me once again you love me, do I dream?</p>
<p>My darling, are we walking close together?<br />
Could we stay like this forever?<br />
Is it true, or am I in a dream?</p>
<p>Will this love go on forever?<br />
Could we share our life together?<br />
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?</p>
<p>Are we walking close together?<br />
Could we stay like this forever?<br />
Is it true, or am I in a dream?</p>
<p>Will this love go on forever?<br />
Could we share our life together?<br />
Do I dream? Do I dream? Do I dream?</p>
