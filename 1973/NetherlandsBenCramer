Through the streets of Paris<br />
Still the same tune sounds<br />
Played by the old musician<br />
You already hear him across the street</p>
<p>Once he was very famous<br />
His name was mentioned all the time<br />
Now he&#8217;s very old and grey<br />
Older than the city of Paris</p>
<p>Through the streets, over squares<br />
Sounds that one song<br />
This melody will never disappear<br />
Even though you don&#8217;t know it</p>
<p>Lonely are his days now<br />
Nobody who knows him anymore<br />
He plays his accordeon<br />
And he thinks of how it once began</p>
<p>Now, life is grubby and grey<br />
In the streets of Paris</p>
<p>His friends don&#8217;t know him anymore<br />
Only now, they look down on him<br />
He still plays for money on the street<br />
From early in the morning till late at night</p>
<p>Nobody who waits for him anymore<br />
But sometimes he seems to be laughing again<br />
He was famous all over the country<br />
That old grey musician</p>
<p>Through the streets, over squares<br />
Sounds that one song<br />
This melody will never disappear<br />
Even though you don&#8217;t know it</p>
<p>Lonely are his days now<br />
Nobody who knows him anymore<br />
He plays his accordeon<br />
And he thinks of how it once began</p>
<p>Now, life is grubby and grey<br />
In the streets of Paris<br />
