Everyone, everything was talking about love<br />
One day, it just had to happen to me<br />
I waited, I expected you<br />
I hoped, I looked for you</p>
<p>But good heavens, you existed<br />
You were the adventure, and now I understand</p>
<p>Without you, what is being free good for?<br />
Without you, tell me, why do we need to live?</p>
<p>You leave (You leave)<br />
My life leaves with you<br />
You come back (You come back)<br />
I&#8217;ve got the sky in my hands</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the emptiness, the emptiness around me<br />
Without you, without you</p>
<p>How good the weather was in the garden tonight<br />
I love your secrets and I&#8217;m afraid of nothing</p>
<p>Without you, what is being free good for?<br />
Without you, tell me, why do we need to live?</p>
<p>You leave (You leave)<br />
My life leaves with you<br />
You come back (You come back)<br />
I&#8217;ve got the sky in my hands</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the emptiness, the emptiness around me<br />
Without you</p>
<p>You leave (You leave)<br />
My life leaves with you<br />
You come back (You come back)<br />
I&#8217;ve got the sky in my hands</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the emptiness, the emptiness around me<br />
Without you</p>
<p>Without you<br />
