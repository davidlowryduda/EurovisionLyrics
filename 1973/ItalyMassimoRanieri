Like our first date a year ago<br />
Today I&#8217;m waiting for somebody else, and everything will recur<br />
We walk a little and while I take her hand<br />
My heart asks me softly</p>
<p>Who will be with you<br />
Maybe her hand will caress yours<br />
Who will be, will be<br />
Even if it&#8217;s as exciting as me with her</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t talk anymore<br />
I come closer and touch her lips<br />
But I think about who will be with you</p>
<p>Sparkling shop windows, mirrors for those in love<br />
Cheap cinemas, unknown streets<br />
She, who looks a bit like you, and the fire relights<br />
But a little nostalgia takes me away</p>
<p>Who will be with you<br />
Who will caress you strongly like me</p>
<p>Who will be, will be<br />
What does it matter now, it&#8217;s as I wanted<br />
My dear love<br />
While I&#8217;m thinking of you, who will be with you<br />
