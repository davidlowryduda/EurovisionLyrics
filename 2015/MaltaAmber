<p>We suffer silently<br />
Always fighting to break free</p>
<p>We were living in a shadow<br />
We were too scared to let go<br />
Wouldn&#8217;t accept defeat<br />
When by losing we were winning</p>
<p>We have to be courageous<br />
To be able to get through this<br />
And then it hits</p>
<p>Break through the silence<br />
The noise is louder then it&#8217;s ever been<br />
Create something timeless<br />
Never look back, the past is the past<br />
I had no choice but to become a warrior</p>
<p>I had to conquer<br />
I did not break, I left my faith in hope</p>
<p>We are not the enemy<br />
We&#8217;re just tired of suffering</p>
<p>We broke through the shadows<br />
We finally let go<br />
And then it hits</p>
<p>Break through the silence<br />
The noise is louder then it&#8217;s ever been<br />
Create something timeless<br />
Never look back, the past is the past<br />
I had no choice but to become a warrior</p>
<p>I had to conquer<br />
I did not break, I left my faith in hope</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a warrior, I will conquer<br />
I&#8217;m a warrior, I will conquer<br />
I&#8217;m a warrior, I will conquer<br />
I&#8217;m a warrior, I will conquer</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a warrior</p>
