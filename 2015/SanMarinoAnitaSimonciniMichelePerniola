<p>No, I don&#8217;t wanna dream forever<br />
Of a time when peace was more than just a simple word<br />
I wanna find a better way of living<br />
And connect my tears and fears with friends</p>
<p>Understanding and forgiving<br />
Must give this world a final chance</p>
<p>I can feel life is changin&#8217;<br />
Times are rearrangin&#8217; in so many, many ways<br />
Let us try to make the world a better place</p>
<p>So light up the candles, let&#8217;s illuminate the night<br />
Just light up the candles, let them shine on deep inside<br />
Build a chain of light for you and a chain of light for me<br />
And believe that we can change reality</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only got one life (We&#8217;ve only got one life)<br />
So let&#8217;s try to make our dreams survive<br />
(Try to make our dreams survive)<br />
Maybe we&#8217;ll find out that many people feel the same (Oh yeah)</p>
<p>One&#8217;s a lonely number, but together<br />
We can make a million candles shine forever<br />
Let us build a chain of hearts in a world that&#8217;s blue and dark</p>
<p>So light up the candles, let&#8217;s illuminate the night<br />
And together hand in hand we will feel the love inside<br />
Build a chain of love for you (Chain of love for you)<br />
And a chain of love for me (Chain of love for me)<br />
We will let our vision change reality</p>
<p>If we all light a candle we could build a chain of light<br />
If we all walk together we will feel the love inside<br />
It&#8217;s a chain of hearts for you (Chain of hearts for you)<br />
And a chain of hearts for me (Chain of hearts for me)<br />
Let&#8217;s create a world that&#8217;s human, fair and bright</p>
<p>If we all light a candle (If we all light a candle)<br />
We&#8217;d illuminate the night (We&#8217;d illuminate the night)<br />
If we all walk together (Yes, we should)<br />
We will feel the love inside</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a chain of light for you (Chain of light for you)<br />
And a chain of light for me (Chain of light for me)<br />
We can build a peaceful world &#8211; let&#8217;s do it right<br />
(Standing side by side)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a chain of love for you (A chain of love for you)<br />
And a chain of love for me (A chain of love for me)<br />
And to make a world that&#8217;s human, fair and bright</p>
