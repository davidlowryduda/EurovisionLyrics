<p>Honey, I&#8217;m telling the truth<br />
I did something terrible in my early youth<br />
My mind went blank, I lost control<br />
I was just a little boy, I did not know</p>
<p>I better let you go<br />
To find the prince you thought you found in me<br />
I better set you free and give you up<br />
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live<br />
Without a monster like me</p>
<p>Honey, what am I to you?<br />
I have pulled the trigger on this awful truth<br />
Oh, hold me now &#8217;cause I&#8217;m burning up<br />
Sing me something beautiful, just make it stop</p>
<p>I better let you go<br />
To find the prince you thought you found in me<br />
I better set you free and give you up<br />
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live<br />
Without a monster like me</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Just go<br />
To find the prince you thought you found in me<br />
I better set you free and give you up<br />
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live<br />
Without a monster like me, oh</p>
<p>Without a monster like me</p>
