It&#8217;s three in the morning and the rain falls on the city streets<br />
Something&#8217;s missing deep inside of me<br />
I try to straighten up, but I have no will to do it at all<br />
I&#8217;m not myself if you&#8217;re not here</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the sea that separates us<br />
I&#8217;ll dry it up with longing<br />
And press you against my chest<br />
In a kiss made of yearning</p>
<p>I can still feel your hands on my face<br />
And the taste of honey of your mouth<br />
Crazy was the night when I met you<br />
Sad was the dawn when I lost you</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the sea that separates us<br />
I&#8217;ll dry it up with longing<br />
And press you against my chest<br />
In a kiss made of yearning</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the sea that separates us<br />
I&#8217;ll dry it up with longing<br />
And press you against my chest<br />
In a kiss made of yearning</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the sea that separates us<br />
