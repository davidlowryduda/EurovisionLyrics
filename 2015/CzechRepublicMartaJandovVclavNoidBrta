<p>Wait for me, don&#8217;t cross the sea of pain<br />
Wait for me, I&#8217;m lost, I&#8217;ve gone astray<br />
Ravens calling my name, their wings so dark<br />
Soon they&#8217;ll take me away, I have their mark<br />
They never miss their prey</p>
<p>There is no light to pray for<br />
Cold and dim are the skies<br />
Wounded, lying, running out of life<br />
Out of life</p>
<p>In your eyes I could see<br />
Our hopes and our future<br />
Now we must let go</p>
<p>Find me where the night turns into day<br />
Turns into day, your love as a torch shows us the way<br />
The way how to be whole again</p>
<p>There is no light to pray for<br />
Cold and dim are the skies<br />
Wounded, lying, running out of life<br />
Out of life</p>
<p>In your eyes I could see<br />
Our hopes and our future<br />
Now we must let go</p>
<p>Must let go, must let fade away<br />
Or we can rise and fight</p>
<p>For a light to live for<br />
Fire in our hearts<br />
Through our pain, through all the<br />
All the lies</p>
<p>We will walk, walk reborn<br />
Hope never dies<br />
Never let me go<br />
Never let me go</p>
