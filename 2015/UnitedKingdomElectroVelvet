<p>Well, don&#8217;t get on the wrong train<br />
Don&#8217;t fly in an old plane<br />
Don&#8217;t go out in the pouring rain<br />
You might get wet, I&#8217;d be upset</p>
<p>You&#8217;re bound to get sneezes<br />
Or nasty diseases<br />
Take good care when I&#8217;m not there<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m on vacation<br />
You be a good patient<br />
Take your medication<br />
I worry so each time I go</p>
<p>Try to keep warm, dear<br />
In case there&#8217;s a storm, dear<br />
Take good care while I&#8217;m not there<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
<p>Some younger guys with roving eyes<br />
May tantalise you with their lies<br />
You must be wise and realise<br />
Leave well alone till you get home, dear</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t see other fellas<br />
Don&#8217;t wanna make you jealous<br />
No need to fear when you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
<p>(Let&#8217;s dance, dance)<br />
(Dance)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t walk on the red light<br />
Don&#8217;t stay out at midnight<br />
Don&#8217;t get in a fist fight<br />
That pretty face can&#8217;t be replaced</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t be out at night, hon<br />
It wouldn&#8217;t be right, hon<br />
No need to fear when you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
<p>Oh yes?<br />
(Everybody dance, everybody dance)<br />
(Everybody dance)<br />
(Everybody dance, everybody dance)</p>
<p>Sounding good, sugar<br />
You take care now, honey</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make a fuss, you need to trust me<br />
This is how it always must be<br />
When I start to think of us<br />
I can assure you, I adore you</p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re so gorgeous<br />
You need to be cautious<br />
Take good care when I&#8217;m not there<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
<p>(Da-da-da-dance)<br />
You have a fun time (Dance)<br />
And soak up that sunshine (Let&#8217;s dance)<br />
But don&#8217;t drink too much wine<br />
Just one or two will have to do (Everybody dance)</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking (Everybody dance)<br />
So I won&#8217;t be drinking<br />
No need to fear when you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still in love with you<br />
I&#8217;m still in love with you</p>
