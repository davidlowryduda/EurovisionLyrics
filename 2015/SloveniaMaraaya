<p>When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
And there&#8217;s no place you can go<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down, love<br />
You know that I am here for you</p>
<p>You came into my life when I was broken<br />
You heated up my heart when it was frozen<br />
And we got the flow, now it&#8217;s up we go</p>
<p>And now that it&#8217;s your turn you wanna hide it<br />
A million times already you&#8217;ve denied it<br />
You don&#8217;t have to fear, you don&#8217;t have to fight</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
Sinking in the undertow<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
You know that I am here for you</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I know, know baby<br />
All the hurt you never show<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
You gotta let me heal your aching soul</p>
<p>You came into my life when I was broken<br />
You heated up my heart when it was frozen<br />
And we got the flow, now it&#8217;s up we go</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you released my pain, now let me take it<br />
Just leave it at the door and we can make it<br />
You don&#8217;t have to hide, I am by your side</p>
<p>Everybody else sees in black and white<br />
You look at wrong and make it right<br />
Can&#8217;t I open your eyes?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
Sinking in the undertow<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
You know that I am here for you</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I know, know baby<br />
All the hurt you never show<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
You gotta let me heal your aching soul</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I know, know baby<br />
All the hurt you never show<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
You gotta let me heal your aching soul</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
Sinking in the undertow<br />
When you&#8217;re down, down low<br />
You know that I am here for you</p>
