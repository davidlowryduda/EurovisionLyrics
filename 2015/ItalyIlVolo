I close my eyes and think of her<br />
The sweet scent of her skin<br />
It&#8217;s a voice inside me taking me away<br />
Where the sun rises</p>
<p>Alone are the words<br />
But if they should be written anything can change<br />
No more fear, I want to shout to you<br />
This great love</p>
<p>Love, only love<br />
Is what I feel</p>
<p>Tell me why when I think, I think only of you<br />
Tell me why when I see, I see only you<br />
Tell me why when I believe, I believe only in you<br />
Great love</p>
<p>Tell me that never, you&#8217;ll never leave me<br />
Tell me who you are, breath of my days of love<br />
Tell me you know that it&#8217;s only me you&#8217;ll choose<br />
Now you know you are my only great love</p>
<p>Tell me why when I think, I think only of you<br />
Tell me why when I love, I love only you<br />
Tell me why when I live, I live only in you<br />
Great love</p>
<p>Tell me that never, you&#8217;ll never leave me<br />
Tell me who you are, breath of my days of love<br />
Tell me you know that I will never go wrong<br />
Tell me that you, that you are my only great love</p>
<p>That you are my only great love<br />
