<p>Tell me where I belong<br />
I&#8217;ve been trying for so long</p>
<p>Breaking out through the night<br />
Made me see the bright light<br />
Now I&#8217;m willing to fight</p>
<p>And I know that time is on my side</p>
<p>Time is like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; hear it like thunder, ah-ah&#8230;<br />
All we&#8217;ve got are some days and I am trying not to waste<br />
Time is like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; beating like thunder in our heads<br />
Time is like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; ah-ah&#8230; ah-ah&#8230;</p>
<p>At the end of the rope<br />
Keep on hoping against all hope, oh-oh&#8230;.</p>
<p>Time is fading away<br />
So don&#8217;t you lose a day<br />
We can do what we say</p>
<p>(Time is like thunder)<br />
(Time is like thunder) I know, you know<br />
(Time is like thunder)<br />
I don&#8217;t want to wait</p>
<p>(Like thunder, like thunder)<br />
(I know, you know) Don&#8217;t you lose a day</p>
<p>Ah ah, hear it like thunder, ah-ah&#8230;<br />
Beating like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; ah-ah&#8230; ah-ah&#8230;</p>
<p>Time is like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; hear it like thunder, ah-ah&#8230;<br />
All we&#8217;ve got are some days and I am trying not to waste<br />
Time is like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; beating like thunder (In our heads)<br />
Time is like thunder, ah-ah&#8230; ah-ah&#8230; ah-ah&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna wait</p>
