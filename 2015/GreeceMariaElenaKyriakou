<p>My soul, I guess I&#8217;m just no one<br />
You killed me and I&#8217;m done, without a gun<br />
My light will fade, I feel betrayed<br />
Just can&#8217;t be brave without faith<br />
How could you leave?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m begging you, take me wherever you have gone<br />
Come back and save me, don&#8217;t want to be alone<br />
Nothing left, I just have one last breath</p>
<p>I&#8217;m begging you, take me out of this fiery hell<br />
Come back and save me, what happened wasn&#8217;t fair<br />
Nothing left, all that I have is one last breath<br />
Only one last breath</p>
<p>Just pain, fake love and drunken lie<br />
I struggle to survive, I&#8217;m still alive<br />
I&#8217;m fighting tears and fears apart<br />
But still it&#8217;s dark inside my heart&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m begging you, take me out of this fiery hell<br />
Come back and save me, what happened wasn&#8217;t fair<br />
Nothing left, all that I have is one last breath<br />
Only one last breath</p>
<p>I&#8217;m begging you, take me wherever you have gone<br />
I&#8217;m begging you, take me, don&#8217;t wanna be alone<br />
All that I have is one last breath<br />
One last breath</p>
