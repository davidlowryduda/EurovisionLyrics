<p>Summer&#8217;s here, winter&#8217;s gone<br />
Finally I can see the sun<br />
Every time you walk into the room</p>
<p>And all my fears disappear<br />
When I&#8217;m in your atmosphere<br />
I don&#8217;t know what it is you do</p>
<p>But you do (Yeah, yeah)<br />
And I can&#8217;t explain why</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are<br />
It&#8217;s just the way that you are<br />
That can make my day<br />
And bad times go away</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are<br />
It&#8217;s just the way that you are<br />
That can make my day<br />
And bad times go away</p>
<p>Like an old radio<br />
A song I just can&#8217;t let go<br />
All I got on my mind is you</p>
<p>Movie stars and caviar<br />
Couldn&#8217;t get me where you are<br />
There&#8217;s nothing I can do about it</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are<br />
It&#8217;s just the way that you are<br />
That can make my day<br />
And bad times go away</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll be right there<br />
When you need someone to guide you (Guide you)<br />
Whatever it takes girl<br />
I will be doing it for you (For you)</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve been acting like a fool<br />
I wanna take my time and spend it all on you<br />
So girl just come and sweep my feet off the ground<br />
Like you do</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are<br />
It&#8217;s just the way that you are<br />
That can make my day<br />
And bad times go away</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are<br />
It&#8217;s just the way that you are<br />
That can make my day<br />
And bad times go away</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s all about you<br />
Because it&#8217;s all about you girl<br />
And I&#8217;m hanging on to every single word you say</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are<br />
It&#8217;s just the way that you are<br />
That can make my day<br />
And bad times go away</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the way you are</p>
