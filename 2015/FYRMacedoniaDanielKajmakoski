<p>Met in the dark of night, you&#8217;re my lucky strike<br />
Crazy kids without a clue<br />
Hanging from our knees in the willow trees<br />
Easy like the month of June</p>
<p>A fairytale gone right with no end in sight<br />
Had me tangled up in blue<br />
You say we never change, but maybe we do, ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Baby, this is all we ever used to know<br />
But I can see your colours change to red and gold</p>
<p>Every moment will hurt, from the last to the first<br />
I&#8217;m trying to find a way to breathe<br />
Close the book and the chapter forever and after<br />
I&#8217;m falling like the autumn leaves</p>
<p>My heart is beating like a million drums<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re the ground under my feet<br />
And I&#8217;m trying to hold on but baby, I&#8217;m falling free<br />
Like the autumn leaves, ooh&#8230;<br />
Like the autumn leaves, ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Baby, this is all I ever had to know<br />
Now I can see your colours change to red and gold</p>
<p>Every moment will hurt, from the last to the first<br />
I&#8217;m trying to find a way to breathe<br />
Close the book and the chapter forever and after<br />
I&#8217;m falling like the autumn leaves</p>
<p>My heart is beating like a million drums<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re the ground under my feet<br />
And I&#8217;m trying to hold on but baby, I&#8217;m falling free<br />
Like the autumn leaves, ooh&#8230;<br />
Like the autumn leaves, ooh&#8230;</p>
