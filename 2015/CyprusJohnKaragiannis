<p>Tonight the rain is falling, I&#8217;m feeling cold<br />
And I&#8217;m out of my mind without you<br />
My head is spinning like a top<br />
Back to the time we had a lot going on</p>
<p>Now my world lies shattered<br />
How quickly life can change</p>
<p>I always did everything for you<br />
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too<br />
You&#8217;d make me feel I was really someone<br />
But there&#8217;s one thing I should&#8217;ve done</p>
<p>One day you think you have it all<br />
The next you&#8217;re staring at the wall, in a dream<br />
The road that once was paved with gold<br />
Has turned a rusty shade of all the saddest colours in the world</p>
<p>Now my life&#8217;s in tatters<br />
How quickly it all can change</p>
<p>I always did everything for you<br />
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too<br />
You&#8217;d make me feel I was really someone<br />
But there&#8217;s one thing I should&#8217;ve done</p>
<p>I should&#8217;ve been there for you<br />
I should&#8217;ve been there for you<br />
I should&#8217;ve been there for you<br />
I should&#8217;ve been there</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t do everything for you<br />
But I tried so hard, and that&#8217;s the truth<br />
I&#8217;d make you feel you were really someone<br />
But there&#8217;s one thing I should&#8217;ve done</p>
<p>I nearly did everything for you<br />
But I broke your heart, now mine&#8217;s broken too<br />
In your hour of need, I didn&#8217;t come<br />
That&#8217;s the one thing I should have done</p>
