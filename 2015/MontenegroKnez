The sky brought you to me, the sky took you from me<br />
What used to hurt still hurts me<br />
My days are the walls, my nights are the shackles<br />
I&#8217;m still serving you, my love</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t give you to the mists of the mountains<br />
I still don&#8217;t give you to the depths of the water<br />
And you ask me to let you go, forever<br />
To let you sink into oblivion and say goodbye</p>
<p>The rosemary has blossomed, the white lilies have bent<br />
Everything smells like sorrow<br />
I try to forget, to not think of you<br />
But my heart is still pining for you</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t give you to the mists of the mountains<br />
I still don&#8217;t give you to the depths of the water<br />
And you ask me to let you go, forever<br />
To let you sink into oblivion</p>
<p>Ah&#8230;<br />
I still don&#8217;t give you to the mists of the mountains<br />
I still don&#8217;t give you to the depths of the water<br />
And you ask me to let you go, forever<br />
To let you sink into oblivion and say goodbye<br />
