<p>Do I owe you something?<br />
I think I do<br />
They tied our hands<br />
But I cut through</p>
<p>In the arms of the potion<br />
They found our truth<br />
And I made a girl<br />
Abandoned youth</p>
<p>And I made the mess in your vision<br />
And I see a debt to be paid<br />
To give a little love was all I wanted<br />
Give a little love was all my intent</p>
<p>And I was playing with numbers<br />
And I didn&#8217;t know what it meant</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t remind me<br />
I won&#8217;t be your muse<br />
Fragile misguided minds like mine<br />
Only know how to use</p>
<p>Oh, while I played with white lies and fiction<br />
Unbeknownst to you<br />
I played the victim<br />
Well that was the last time I faced you</p>
<p>And I made the mess in your vision<br />
And I see a debt to be paid<br />
To give a little love was all I wanted<br />
Give a little love was all my intent</p>
<p>And I was playing with numbers<br />
And I didn&#8217;t know what it meant</p>
<p>I can watch from afar, from my art on my own<br />
All along I was lost, I was wild, this is wrong<br />
I can&#8217;t force this, just watch as the surface surrenders it all</p>
<p>I made the mess in your vision<br />
And I see a debt to be paid<br />
To give a little love was all I wanted<br />
Give a little love was all my intent</p>
<p>I was playing with numbers<br />
And I didn&#8217;t know what it meant</p>
