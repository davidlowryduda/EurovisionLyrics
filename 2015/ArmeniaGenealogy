<p>We find so many ways of fooling our heart<br />
Playing too many games, trying to hide<br />
When you follow your dream, surrender the sorrow inside<br />
Face every shadow you denied</p>
<p>Feels like so many times life was unfair<br />
Will you run and forget all the despair?<br />
If it&#8217;s breaking you down, remember the power inside<br />
Face every shadow you denied</p>
<p>Time is ticking and you keep thinking<br />
That you are tricking your heart</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t deny<br />
Ever, don&#8217;t deny<br />
Baby, don&#8217;t deny<br />
You and I</p>
<p>Cross the ocean of blues, happy you&#8217;ll be<br />
Once you&#8217;ve risen you are meant to be free<br />
When you&#8217;re feeling afraid remember there&#8217;s hope inside<br />
Face every shadow purified</p>
<p>Time is ticking and you keep thinking<br />
(Time is ticking, thinking)<br />
That you are tricking your heart</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t deny<br />
Ever, don&#8217;t deny<br />
Listen, don&#8217;t deny (I don&#8217;t want to deny)<br />
You and I</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t deny<br />
Ever, don&#8217;t deny<br />
Listen, don&#8217;t deny (Listen)<br />
Don&#8217;t deny you and I</p>
