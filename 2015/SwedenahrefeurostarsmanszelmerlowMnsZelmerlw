<p>Don&#8217;t tell the gods I left a mess<br />
I can&#8217;t undo what has been done<br />
Let&#8217;s run for cover</p>
<p>What if I&#8217;m the only hero left?<br />
You better fire off your gun<br />
Once and forever</p>
<p>He said go dry your eyes<br />
And live your life like there is no tomorrow, son<br />
And tell the others</p>
<p>To go sing it like a hummingbird<br />
The greatest anthem ever heard</p>
<p>We are the heroes of our time<br />
But we&#8217;re dancing with the demons in our minds</p>
<p>We are the heroes of our time<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;<br />
But we&#8217;re dancing with the demons in our minds<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>We are the heroes of our time<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;<br />
But we&#8217;re dancing with the demons in our minds<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>The crickets sing a song for you<br />
Don&#8217;t say a word, don&#8217;t make a sound<br />
It&#8217;s life&#8217;s creation</p>
<p>I make worms turn into butterflies<br />
Wake up and turn this world around<br />
In appreciation</p>
<p>He said I never left your side<br />
When you were lost I followed right behind<br />
Was your foundation</p>
<p>Now go sing it like a hummingbird<br />
The greatest anthem ever heard<br />
Now sing together</p>
<p>We are the heroes of our time<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;<br />
But we&#8217;re dancing with the demons in our minds<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>We are the heroes<br />
(We keep dancing with the demons)<br />
(You could be a hero)</p>
<p>Now go sing it like a hummingbird<br />
The greatest anthem ever heard<br />
Now sing together</p>
<p>We are the heroes of our time<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;<br />
But we&#8217;re dancing with the demons in our minds<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>We are the heroes of our time<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;<br />
But we&#8217;re dancing with the demons in our minds<br />
Heroes, oh whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>We are the heroes</p>
