<p>We are the world&#8217;s people<br />
Different yet we&#8217;re the same<br />
We believe, we believe in a dream</p>
<p>Praying for peace and healing<br />
I hope we can start again<br />
We believe, we believe in a dream</p>
<p>So if you ever feel love is fading<br />
Together like the stars in the sky<br />
We can sing, we can shine </p>
<p>When you hear our voices call<br />
You won&#8217;t be lonely anymore<br />
A, a million voices</p>
<p>Your heart is like a beating drum<br />
Burning brighter than the sun<br />
A, a million voices</p>
<p>Now as the world is listening<br />
From cities and satellites<br />
We believe, we believe in a dream</p>
<p>If you ever feel love is fading<br />
Together like the stars in the sky<br />
We can sing, we can shine </p>
<p>When you hear our voices call<br />
You won&#8217;t be lonely anymore<br />
A, a million voices</p>
<p>Your heart is like a beating drum<br />
Burning brighter than the sun<br />
A, a million voices</p>
<p>When I look around at these faces<br />
I can see the stars in the sky<br />
We will sing, we will shine</p>
<p>(When you hear our voices call)<br />
(You won&#8217;t be lonely anymore)<br />
(A, a million voices)</p>
<p>Singing out, singing out, oh<br />
Singing out, singing out, oh<br />
Singing out, a million voices</p>
<p>Singing out, singing out, oh<br />
Singing out, singing out, oh<br />
Singing out, a million voices<br />
A million voices</p>
