<p>Ay yi yi yi yi yi&#8230;<br />
Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Ay yi yi yi yi yi&#8230;<br />
Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I was too afraid right from the start<br />
To even let you, welcome you in my heart<br />
You cut it deep and left it bleeding hard<br />
Will I ever heal these painful scars?</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t help it<br />
I&#8217;m out of breath, I&#8217;m trying to find the words to say<br />
Time passed by<br />
Now it&#8217;s broad daylight</p>
<p>I know you will come with the speed of the light<br />
You&#8217;re my everything, all that I need<br />
You shut down my dreams, but I&#8217;m not gonna cry<br />
You live within me, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m alive</p>
<p>I am alive, &#8217;cause you are my life<br />
You are my sun<br />
I am alive, &#8217;cause you are my life</p>
<p>Ay yi yi yi yi yi&#8230;<br />
Yeah yeah yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Ay yi yi yi yi yi&#8230;<br />
Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Your name is printed crystal clear on glass<br />
From all the sighs coming out of my breath<br />
I&#8217;m blinded by this love, can&#8217;t stop screaming out your name so loud<br />
Where are you at? Baby, won&#8217;t you come back?</p>
<p>(Baby, please come back)<br />
(Baby, please come back)<br />
(Baby, please come back)</p>
<p>I know you will come with the speed of the light<br />
You&#8217;re my everything, all that I need<br />
You shut down my dreams, but I&#8217;m not gonna cry<br />
You live within me, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m alive</p>
<p>I am alive, &#8217;cause you are my life<br />
You are my sun<br />
I am alive, &#8217;cause you are my life<br />
Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>(I know you will come with the speed of the light)<br />
You&#8217;re my everything, you&#8217;re all that I need<br />
You shut down my dreams, but I&#8217;m not gonna cry<br />
You live within me, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m alive</p>
<p>I am alive, &#8217;cause you are my life<br />
You are my sun<br />
I am alive, &#8217;cause you are my life</p>
<p>(Ay yi yi yi yi yi&#8230;)<br />
(Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;) You are my life</p>
