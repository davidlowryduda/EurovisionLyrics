Only tears remain for me<br />
These few notes from the past<br />
And the song of our prayers, our hearts that are hoping<br />
And the emptiness under my steps</p>
<p>Only ashes remain for me<br />
Of my village plunged into silence<br />
I am only a wound, a heart without armour<br />
How to survive after that?</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m here, I don&#8217;t forget<br />
In my village swept away by history<br />
And I live there, don&#8217;t forget<br />
Erased from the maps and memories</p>
<p>I remember the children laughing<br />
The voices of the men leaving for the field<br />
The harvest festivals, the smell inside houses<br />
The bursts of love and joy</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m here, don&#8217;t forget<br />
Erased from the maps and memories</p>
<p>When they arrived, hidden behind their weapons<br />
There were thousands, they laughed at our tears<br />
They wanted to destroy our beliefs under their fire<br />
With words of hatred which were unknown to us</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here tonight in the middle of these ruins<br />
To talk to you about hope and to sing to you about life<br />
And I swear that when the blood dries<br />
I will rebuild my village even more beautiful than before<br />
But don&#8217;t forget<br />
