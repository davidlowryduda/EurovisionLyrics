<p>One step at a time, out of the darkness<br />
One foot in front of the other<br />
One step at a time, into the distance<br />
New path I need to uncover<br />
I&#8217;m letting go&#8230; go&#8230;</p>
<p>One step at a time, get out of the darkness<br />
And into the light forever<br />
One step at a time and pick up the pieces<br />
Try putting them back together</p>
<p>Till I&#8217;m unbroken, unbroken<br />
One step at a time, get out of the darkness<br />
And into the light forever</p>
<p>One step at a time and I got a feeling<br />
It&#8217;s either now or never<br />
I&#8217;m letting go&#8230; go&#8230;</p>
<p>One step at a time, get out of the darkness<br />
And into the light forever<br />
One step at a time and pick up the pieces<br />
Try putting them back together</p>
<p>Till I&#8217;m unbroken, unbroken<br />
One step at a time, get out of the darkness<br />
And into the light forever</p>
<p>I&#8217;m letting go&#8230; go&#8230;</p>
<p>One step at a time, get out of the darkness<br />
And into the light forever<br />
One step at a time and pick up the pieces<br />
Try putting them back together</p>
<p>Till I&#8217;m unbroken, unbroken<br />
One step at a time, get out of the darkness<br />
And into the light forever</p>
