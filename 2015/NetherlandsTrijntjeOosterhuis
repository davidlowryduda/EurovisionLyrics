<p>I open up my heart to you<br />
And cry for your attention<br />
Still you haven&#8217;t seen it yet</p>
<p>You only see me as a friend<br />
But I wish you were waiting<br />
With roses in sunset, yeah</p>
<p>Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?<br />
Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?</p>
<p>I gently smile passing your way<br />
It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t try enough<br />
But you don&#8217;t even notice me here</p>
<p>In another time and place<br />
Another lifetime maybe<br />
If only for a little while, oh-oh</p>
<p>Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?<br />
Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?</p>
<p>(Why, why-yi-yi-yi) I don&#8217;t seem to get you<br />
(Why-yi-yi-yi) To look at me one time<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?</p>
<p>(Why, why-yi-yi-yi) This is not a little crush<br />
(Why-yi-yi-yi) Don&#8217;t wanna wait in line<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?</p>
<p>Ooh-hoo&#8230; ooh-hoo&#8230;<br />
I love you, I love you ba-baby<br />
Ooh-hoo&#8230; ooh-hoo&#8230;<br />
If only for a little while, oh-oh</p>
<p>Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?<br />
Why, why-y-y-y, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?</p>
<p>Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
I love you, I love you ba-baby<br />
Why, why-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi<br />
Won&#8217;t you walk along, walk along, baby?</p>
