He left without knowing that I did love him<br />
He left without believing in me<br />
I lost my mind, I bled so much love<br />
That still, today I feel empty<br />
I take it with me</p>
<p>Eh yeah yeah&#8230; eh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
My heart whispered to me<br />
Don&#8217;t come back without your love</p>
<p>I walked to yesterday wherever you are<br />
Today I challenge myself to forget<br />
He left without knowing that I&#8217;m not giving up</p>
<p>Eh yeah yeah&#8230; eh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
My heart whispered to me<br />
Don&#8217;t come back without your love</p>
<p>Eh yeah yeah&#8230; eh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Breathe my soul back into me<br />
Bring the dawn back to me</p>
<p>Today you come back with me</p>
<p>Eh yeah yeah&#8230; eh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
My heart whispered to me<br />
Don&#8217;t come back without your love</p>
<p>Eh yeah yeah&#8230; eh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Breathe my soul back into me<br />
Bring the dawn back to me</p>
<p>Eh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
