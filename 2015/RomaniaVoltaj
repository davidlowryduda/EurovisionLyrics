If my life was a song<br />
Happy, sad, I would still sing it<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t miss a note</p>
<p>If it was a river, I would swim<br />
I would follow it to the sea<br />
I would never stop<br />
Remember</p>
<p>Life doesn&#8217;t have a rewind button to<br />
Be able to regain what you have lost<br />
You can&#8217;t even put it on pause<br />
When you don&#8217;t know what to do</p>
<p>If tomorrow night is without a star<br />
If the wind kept blowing towards me<br />
You are the reason; you are the reason to be able<br />
To be able to start from the beginning</p>
<p>If tomorrow the sky was full of clouds<br />
If no sun ray touches me in the morning<br />
You are the reason; you are the reason to be able<br />
To be able to start from the beginning</p>
<p>I would fly all night long<br />
Towards the morning, if it was you<br />
The rain wouldn&#8217;t be able to understand<br />
Why I am wet without any raindrops</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>If the stars tomorrow no longer shine on us<br />
If a strong wind blows me I will not make a fuss<br />
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start<br />
To start all over again</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>If the sky clouds over, with darkness never gone<br />
If the sun stays hidden, not waking in the dawn<br />
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start<br />
To start all over again</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>To start all over again<br />
To start all over again<br />
To start all over again</em></font><br />
To be able to start from the beginning<br />
