<p>Mama, someone broke my heart again<br />
Tell her I don&#8217;t think I can take it any more<br />
Whoa mama, someone broke my heart again<br />
Now I&#8217;m gonna ease my pain, dancing on the floor</p>
<p>Take me out, I&#8217;m not in the mood for a broken heart<br />
Gonna dance tonight, forget her<br />
No, she doesn&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing on the floor<br />
Did you say hello, my ladies?</p>
<p>Pull me baby, I&#8217;m your trigger<br />
You know that my love is bigger<br />
Love, love, love, love<br />
(Love, love, love)</p>
<p>Let the rhythm take us higher<br />
You know when I&#8217;m on fire<br />
Check me out<br />
(3, 2, 1, hey)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a golden boy, come here to enjoy<br />
I&#8217;m the king of fun, let me show you how we do it<br />
I&#8217;m a golden boy, come here to enjoy<br />
And before I leave, let me show you Tel Aviv</p>
<p>Hold me tight, we&#8217;re not going home tonight<br />
Oh yeah, do you like my dancing?</p>
<p>Pull me baby, I&#8217;m your trigger<br />
You know that my love is bigger<br />
Check me out<br />
(3, 2, 1, hey)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a golden boy, come here to enjoy<br />
I&#8217;m the king of fun, let me show you how we do it<br />
I&#8217;m a golden boy, come here to enjoy<br />
And before I leave, let me show you Tel Aviv</p>
<p>This is how we do it<br />
This is how we do it</p>
