<p>I&#8217;ve been walking in the darkness<br />
Always hiding from my true self<br />
Afraid of letting go, of deception in their eyes<br />
A wounded ego, not afraid to start a fight</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been walking on a lonely road<br />
So many stories I have once been told<br />
No matter what they say I will follow my heart<br />
I think it&#8217;s time for me to stand up and hold my ground</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m living my dreams, I&#8217;ve never been so alive<br />
The sky&#8217;s the limit now that I know I can fly<br />
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around<br />
I&#8217;m growing up, I&#8217;m growing up and it&#8217;s my time to shine<br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s my time to shine</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;m wrong or right<br />
I&#8217;m getting stronger every time I try<br />
I&#8217;ve learnt to let it go, taking one step at a time<br />
I&#8217;ve mend my ego, now it&#8217;s time for me to let it shine</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m living my dreams, I&#8217;ve never been so alive<br />
The sky&#8217;s the limit now that I know I can fly<br />
No more pulling me down, no more mucking around<br />
I&#8217;m growing up, I&#8217;m growing up and it&#8217;s my time to shine<br />
Yeah, it&#8217;s my time to shine</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my time to shine</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been walking in the darkness<br />
Always hiding from my true self<br />
I&#8217;ve learned to let it go (I&#8217;ve learned to let it go)<br />
I&#8217;ve learned to let it go (I&#8217;ve learned to let it go)<br />
I&#8217;ve learned to let it go, now it&#8217;s my time to shine</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m living my dreams, I&#8217;ve never been so alive<br />
I&#8217;m living my dreams&#8230; (The sky&#8217;s the limit now that I know I can fly)<br />
Ooh&#8230; (No more pulling me down, no more mucking around)<br />
Hey hey, I know (I&#8217;m growing up, I&#8217;m growing up and it&#8217;s my time to shine)</p>
<p>(&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m living my dreams, I&#8217;ve never been so alive)<br />
I&#8217;ve never been so alive, alive (The sky&#8217;s the limit now that I know I can fly)<br />
(No more pulling me down, no more mucking around)<br />
(I&#8217;m growing up, I&#8217;m growing up and it&#8217;s my time to shine)<br />
It&#8217;s my time, ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s my time to shine<br />
(It&#8217;s my time to&#8230;) It&#8217;s my time to shine<br />
(It&#8217;s my time to, my time to&#8230;) It&#8217;s my time to shine</p>
