<p>I woke up at 6am<br />
My eyes were closed but my mind was awake<br />
Pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace</p>
<p>Got dressed so quietly<br />
I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door<br />
As I got outside I smiled to the dog</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t wanna wake you up<br />
My love was never gonna be enough<br />
So I took my things and got out of your way now, girl</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t you wake me up<br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure I would have told you to stop<br />
Let&#8217;s try again and say goodbye<br />
Goodbye to yesterday</p>
<p>Why would you think like that?<br />
Yeah we fight a lot but in the end<br />
You and I, we&#8217;re a perfect match</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way<br />
But now you&#8217;re gone and I&#8217;m all alone<br />
Lying here naked and staring at the phone</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t wanna wake you up<br />
My love was never gonna be enough<br />
So I took my things and got out of your way now, girl</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t you wake me up<br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure I would have told you to stop<br />
Let&#8217;s try again and say goodbye<br />
Goodbye to yesterday</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t wanna wake you up<br />

I&#8217;m pretty sure I would have told you to stop<br />
Let&#8217;s try again and say goodbye<br />
Goodbye to yesterday</p>
<p>Goodbye to yesterday<br />
Goodbye to yesterday</p>
