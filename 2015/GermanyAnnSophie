<p>When you look at me, you know you&#8217;re hard to read<br />
Because the face I see is not the one I know<br />
And when you call me baby, what&#8217;s that supposed to mean?<br />
I don&#8217;t know who you are, how long can we pretend?</p>
<p>See the change I know<br />
We both don&#8217;t have the heart to say<br />
Can&#8217;t return to what we were<br />
It will never be the same</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you said you&#8217;d never let me go<br />
And I said I can&#8217;t but now we know<br />
That it&#8217;s too hard to say three words<br />
Too hard to make it work</p>
<p>When there&#8217;s nothing left to talk about<br />
&#8216;Cause you know the flame is running out<br />
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know<br />
We&#8217;re only left with smoke</p>
<p>Black smoke<br />
We&#8217;re only left with smoke<br />
Black smoke</p>
<p>I tried to tell myself, that it&#8217;s all in my head<br />
But the truth remains, we&#8217;re just too far apart<br />
You know we&#8217;re fooling ourselves if we hold on<br />
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;re fighting for something that we don&#8217;t want<br />
Just leave it now and walk away</p>
<p>See the change I know<br />
We both don&#8217;t have the heart to say<br />
Can&#8217;t return to what we were<br />
It will never be the same</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you said you&#8217;d never let me go<br />
And I said I can&#8217;t but now we know<br />
That it&#8217;s too hard to say three words<br />
Too hard to make it work</p>
<p>When there&#8217;s nothing left to talk about<br />
&#8216;Cause you know the flame is running out<br />
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know<br />
We&#8217;re only left with smoke</p>
<p>(Too hard to say three words) Black smoke<br />
(Too hard to make it work) We&#8217;re only left with smoke<br />
(Too hard to say three words) Black smoke<br />
(Too hard to make it work)</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you said you&#8217;d never let me go, oh no<br />
Yeah, you said you&#8217;d never let me go</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you said you&#8217;d never let me go<br />
And I said I can&#8217;t but now we know<br />
That it&#8217;s too hard to say three words<br />
Too hard to make it work</p>
<p>When there&#8217;s nothing left to talk about<br />
&#8216;Cause you know the flame is running out<br />
Two hearts are left to burn, do you know<br />
We&#8217;re only left with smoke</p>
<p>Black smoke<br />
We&#8217;re only left with smoke<br />
Black smoke<br />
We&#8217;re only left with smoke</p>
