<p>Anytime that you&#8217;re thinking of me<br />
That you might want me, I&#8217;ll come on over<br />
Don&#8217;t you know, anytime, anyplace, I am yours</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a lesson that I love learning<br />
So anytime that you&#8217;ve got a yearning<br />
Don&#8217;t you know, anytime, anyplace, I am yours</p>
<p>You&#8217;re what I belong to, the one thing that feels true<br />
Everything that I could ever want<br />
If you ever need me, I&#8217;m waiting on you<br />
To walk right through that door, anytime, any place, I am yours</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re hoping for second chances<br />
Of stolen kisses, I got the answer<br />
Don&#8217;t you know, anytime, anyplace, I&#8217;m yours</p>
<p>You&#8217;re what I belong to, the one thing that feels true<br />
Everything I could ever want<br />
If you ever need me, I&#8217;m waiting on you<br />
To walk right through that door, anytime, any place, I&#8217;m yours</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re what I belong to, the one thing that feels true<br />
Everything I could ever want<br />
If you ever need me, I&#8217;m waiting on you<br />
To walk right through that door, anytime, any place, I&#8217;m yours<br />
Anytime, any place, I&#8217;m yours</p>
