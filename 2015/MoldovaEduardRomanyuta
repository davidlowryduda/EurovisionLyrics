<p>Hey girl<br />
Remind me why we ain&#8217;t together<br />
We got that magnetic connection<br />
Moving so fast, let&#8217;s take it slow<br />
Ain&#8217;t gonna let you let me go</p>
<p>The future that you&#8217;re painting<br />
Got me all anticipating, go!</p>
<p>Nothing can steal your thunder<br />
Sky high when you pull me under<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, want</p>
<p>Yeah baby, let me show ya<br />
You got me trippin&#8217; over<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, I want your love</p>
<p>I want your love, I want your love<br />
I want your love</p>
<p>Hey girl<br />
Even if there&#8217;s stormy weather<br />
You&#8217;ve got my heart beat-beating faster<br />
And I&#8217;m not gonna let you down<br />
No, your feet ain&#8217;t gonna touch the ground, oh</p>
<p>The picture that you&#8217;re painting<br />
Got me all anticipating, go!</p>
<p>Nothing can steal your thunder<br />
Sky high when you pull me under<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, want</p>
<p>Yeah baby, let me show ya<br />
You got me trippin&#8217; over<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, I want your love</p>
<p>I want your love, I want your love<br />
I want your love</p>
<p>Oh yeah<br />
The picture that you&#8217;re painting<br />
Got me anticipating, whoa-oh</p>
<p>Nothing can steal your thunder<br />
Sky high when you pull me under<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, I want your love</p>
<p>Yeah baby, let me show ya<br />
You got me trippin&#8217; over<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, I want your love</p>
<p>Nothing can steal your thunder<br />
Sky high when you pull me under<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, want</p>
<p>Yeah baby, let me show ya<br />
You got me drifting over<br />
&#8216;Cause you got what I want, what I want<br />
What I want, want, want, I want your love</p>
<p>I want your love, I want your love<br />
I want your love</p>
