You, who look for the star<br />
You, who live a dream<br />
You, heroes of space<br />
With a heart bigger than earth</p>
<p>You, give me my chance<br />
Take me far away from here</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave without me, let me follow you<br />
You, who fly to other existences, let me live<br />
The most beautiful adventure, the most beautiful voyage<br />
Which will lead one day to suns, to planets of love</p>
<p>You, the new poets<br />
You, the magic birds<br />
You, maybe you will<br />
Find new music</p>
<p>You, give me my chance<br />
I want to sing too</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave without me, let me follow you<br />
You, who fly to other existences, let me live<br />
The blue of infinity, the joy of being free<br />
On rays, on suns, on songs, on wonders<br />
And in a sky of love</p>
<p>The blue of infinity, the joy of being free<br />
You, who look for another existence<br />
You, who fly towards the year 2000<br />
Don&#8217;t leave without me<br />
