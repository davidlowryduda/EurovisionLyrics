<p>So much to do, so little time<br />
You ask me, can I change the world?<br />
And then, for everybody&#8217;s sake<br />
What are the changes I would make?</p>
<p>And you can dream, dream on, my friend<br />
You have the right<br />
There is something we can do<br />
Something we can do, it&#8217;s so easy</p>
<p>If I light a candle for everybody I know<br />
I could see forever down that long, long road<br />
So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know<br />
Brother, if he needs you, take him home</p>
<p>You can look him in the eye and hold out your hand<br />
Tell him you&#8217;re a brother and he&#8217;ll understand<br />
So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know<br />
Brother, if he needs you&#8230;<br />
Brother, if he needs you, take him home</p>
<p>So if you meet somebody, it might be someone I know<br />
Brother, if he needs you&#8230;<br />
Brother, if he needs you&#8230;<br />
Brother, if he needs you, take him home<br />
Brother, if he needs you, take him home</p>
