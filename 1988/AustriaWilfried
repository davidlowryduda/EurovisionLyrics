She sleeps during the day and dances at night<br />
I hear her crying when she laughs<br />
And she laughs again and again</p>
<p>She sees clearly at night and needs no light<br />
She paints fairy tales on her face<br />
And she laughs me down</p>
<p>Sometime I learn to see her<br />
Sometime I begin<br />
Can I look behind her colours?</p>
<p>(Lisa, Mona Lisa)<br />
(Lisa, Mona Lisa)</p>
<p>She&#8217;s lying but no liar<br />
She carries her life in her face, and she lives</p>
<p>Somehow it&#8217;s very difficult to see her<br />
Somehow I&#8217;m glad<br />
To sometimes understand her dreams</p>
<p>Lisa, Mona Lisa<br />
Lisa, Mona Lisa</p>
<p>Lisa, Mona Lisa<br />
Lisa, Mona Lisa</p>
<p>She&#8217;s tumbling through the glittering town<br />
Searching for someone, who has a smile for her<br />
Somehow</p>
<p>Somehow I like her<br />
And somehow I love her<br />
And somehow I will understand her</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230;<br />
Lisa, Mona Lisa<br />
Lisa, Mona Lisa</p>
<p>Lisa, Mona Lisa<br />
Lisa, Mona Lisa</p>
<p>Lisa, oh, Mona Lisa<br />
Lisa (Mona Lisa)<br />
