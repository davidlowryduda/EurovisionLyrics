Do you know the kind of person who knows everything for certain<br />
And who likes trampling on you when you lie down?<br />
He whistles if it turns out that you&#8217;re at fault<br />
Then he says gloatingly, and infuriatingly with his silly little laugh:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? Do you agree or what?<br />
And who&#8217;s the smartest of us?<br />
Don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? Maybe you&#8217;d better<br />
Listen a little to me, I&#8217;d claim</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not because I like to give in<br />
I think I deserve that credit<br />
But don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? I definitely think<br />
I&#8217;d agree with you if only you were me</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t name anybody by their name but you do know<br />
I thinking of one particular person, it&#8217;s someone you know fairly well<br />
And with a bit of luck you should be able to guess it<br />
And if it&#8217;s the right one then you can say yourself:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? Do you agree or what?<br />
And who&#8217;s the smartest of us?<br />
Don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? Maybe you&#8217;d better<br />
Listen a little to me, I&#8217;d claim</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not because I like to give in<br />
I think I deserve that credit<br />
But don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? I definitely think<br />
I&#8217;d agree with you if only you were me</p>
<p>You walk around as in a trance and if you get your chance<br />
Then I know for sure<br />
That I&#8217;ll be the target, because you&#8217;ll tease me and say<br />
(You&#8217;ll tease and tease), then I&#8217;ll say:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? Do you agree or what?<br />
And who&#8217;s the smartest of us?<br />
Don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? Maybe you&#8217;d better<br />
Listen a little to me, I&#8217;d claim</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not because I like to give in<br />
I think I deserve that credit<br />
But don&#8217;t you see, that&#8217;s what I told you? I definitely think<br />
I&#8217;d agree with you if only you were me<br />
