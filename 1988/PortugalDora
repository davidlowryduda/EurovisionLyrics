(I&#8217;ll come back to you, I&#8217;ll wait for you)<br />
(I&#8217;ll love you like this) Will you come back to me?<br />
I&#8217;ll wait for you, I&#8217;ll suffer for you<br />
I&#8217;ll come back for you, let&#8217;s play the game until the end</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin like this, now it&#8217;s my turn<br />
I&#8217;m standing here and you can&#8217;t see because you&#8217;ve gone blind<br />
I pretended I had another love to replace you<br />
Now you&#8217;re winning by two to&#8230;</p>
<p>One without you, I lost you because I loved you like this<br />
The one who laughs the most, cries in the end</p>
<p>The game is over, the night has gone by<br />
Who lost or who won, I&#8217;ve already forgotten<br />
Ah, cat and mouse game, love is like the sea<br />
With tides that come and go and&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll come back to you, I&#8217;ll come back to you<br />
I&#8217;ll wait for you, will you come back to me?<br />
(I&#8217;ll wait for you) I&#8217;ll suffer for you<br />
I&#8217;ll come back to you, the one who laughs the most cries in the end<br />
I&#8217;ll come back to you<br />
