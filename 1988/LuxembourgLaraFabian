No, I don&#8217;t want to sing on crying lyrics<br />
Such as the sound of a too dark violin<br />
We, we see life with the eyes of the heart<br />
Nothing can keep us from believing in it</p>
<p>Believing in the new world we have in our heads<br />
Believing in us in order to change tomorrow<br />
Even believing in lies if this can stop them<br />
Believing in the lines in our hands</p>
<p>Believing in the sky filled up with birds<br />
Still believing in the space between your arms<br />
Believing in the colour of your skin<br />
Believing that we won&#8217;t march in step anymore</p>
<p>Believing that we&#8217;re twenty<br />
Believing that we can build a volcanic ground<br />
Believing that we can scream</p>
<p>When we have love within us<br />
