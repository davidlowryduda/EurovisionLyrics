No one knows who she is<br />
No one dares to go too close<br />
Where she stands with loud cries<br />
And large eyes that never meet ours</p>
<p>She looks into forgotten lands<br />
People believe she has lost her mind</p>
<p>She is among those guarding the flame (For our earth)<br />
One of those keeping the branches together (For our earth)<br />
She sees that the earth is our mother, stand guard, for our earth</p>
<p>Everyone looks in another direction<br />
The chattering dies out, we exchange glances and smile<br />
Her screams are without skin<br />
She carries a message from the earth</p>
<p>She is among those guarding the flame (For our earth)<br />
One of those keeping the branches together (For our earth)</p>
<p>She is among those struggling in the current (For our earth)<br />
One of those who never wake from the dream (For our earth)<br />
She sees that the earth is our mother</p>
<p>(Stand guard) And let the flame burn<br />
(Stand guard) No matter what happens<br />
(Stand guard) Stand guard for our earth<br />
