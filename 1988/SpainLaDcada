Where is, to the south of parallel forty-three<br />
The craziest and coldest girl?<br />
What does she have, that bothers everyone who sees her<br />
Changing them with her philosophy?</p>
<p>&#8216;Made in Spain&#8217; tattooed on her skin<br />
A hundred thousand watts of sun shining on me everyday<br />
Made in Spain, special passport<br />
She&#8217;s made in Spain, the best guarantee</p>
<p>But I feel bad in the hours of abstinence<br />
They&#8217;re all so cold<br />
And finally she wins with her natural vein<br />
If I feel bad, she gives me energy</p>
<p>Her feminine loose hair, her confidential heart<br />
Her eyes looking in stereo<br />
Who is she? Nobody knows<br />
The girl that I love, I want a &#8216;made in Spain&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Made in Spain&#8217; tattooed on her skin<br />
A hundred thousand watts of sun shining on me everyday<br />
Made in Spain, special passport<br />
She&#8217;s made in Spain, the best guarantee</p>
<p>(Made in Spain, ah&#8230;)<br />
Who is she? Nobody knows<br />
The girl that I love, I want a &#8216;made in Spain&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Made in Spain&#8217; tattooed on her skin<br />
A hundred thousand watts of sun shining on me everyday<br />
Made in Spain, special passport<br />
She&#8217;s made in Spain, the best guarantee</p>
<p>Made in Spain, Made in Spain, Made in Spain<br />
