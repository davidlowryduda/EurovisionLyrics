My journey was towards the sun<br />
Far away from all the closed rooms<br />
Where nothing ever ends<br />
And where there are no borders anymore</p>
<p>I wanted to see the miracle<br />
And hear the words that give birth to life<br />
I want to be carried by a force<br />
Which will grow stronger when I know what I want</p>
<p>The city of light, in a country without a name<br />
Give me life, where everything is born again</p>
<p>And when everything has changed<br />
When time does no longer exist<br />
I can see the two of us together<br />
And then the end of the journey is all we remember</p>
<p>The city of light, in a country without a name<br />
Give me life, where everything is born again</p>
<p>The city of light, in a country without a name<br />
Give&#8230; give me life, where everything is born again<br />
