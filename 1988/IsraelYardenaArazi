<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span></p>
<p>A human being is only flesh and blood<br />
Dust flying in the desert<br />
A human being, in the way of the world<br />
Like a passing shadow, like broken pottery</p>
<p>A man is just a man and most of his days are nights<br />
And no man is perfect in all virtues<br />
So let him dream and give him breath<br />
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t burden him and give him hope<br />
And don&#8217;t always judge him for the worse<br />
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man</p>
<p>A human being awakens and already falls asleep<br />
His days are short, their end is sad<br />
A human being is a guest in the world<br />
He came from ashes and to ashes he will return</p>
<p>A man is just a man and most of his days are nights<br />
And no man is perfect in all virtues<br />
So let him dream and give him breath<br />
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t burden him and give him hope<br />
And don&#8217;t always judge him for the worse<br />
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man</p>
<p>He won&#8217;t learn forever<br />
He forgets to love<br />
He doesn&#8217;t know that his day is near</p>
<p>Because a man is just a man and most of his days are nights<br />
And no man is perfect in all virtues<br />
So let him dream and give him breath<br />
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t burden him and give him hope<br />
And don&#8217;t always judge him for the worse<br />
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man</p>
<p>A man is just a man and most of his days are nights<br />
And no man is perfect in all virtues<br />
So let him dream and give him breath<br />
Give to Shem, give to Ham, give to Japheth comfort</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t burden him and give him hope<br />
And don&#8217;t always judge him for the worse<br />
For a man is a man, is a man, is just a man<br />
