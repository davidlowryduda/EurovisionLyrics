Need to hear tender songs of a schoolboy<br />
Words dancing on paper<br />
Need to believe all these stories of three times nothing<br />
Which rhyme badly, which do good</p>
<p>Nothing has ever prevented us from setting to music<br />
Those endlessly repeated clichés, romantic feelings</p>
<p>Crooner<br />
It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s great, it&#8217;s wonderful<br />
Crooner, crooner</p>
<p>Autumn road, summer passions, colours of the weather<br />
The winter sun, the spring rain<br />
The history of men – the kings, the madmen, the conquerors<br />
Were searching for their Sleeping Beauty</p>
<p>Well, pianos, moonlight, walking in prose<br />
And my heart which stupidly proposes on the first page of a paper</p>
<p>Crooner<br />
It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s great, it&#8217;s wonderful<br />
Crooner that makes lovers love one another</p>
<p>In the uproar of our cities, I make a wish<br />
Crooner, crooner</p>
<p>Crooner, crooner<br />
