<p>I never felt like this before<br />
Seein&#8217; you again only makes me sad<br />
I recall the times when we<br />
Were in love and had everything, it makes me so sad</p>
<p>Time is meant to heal the pain I thought was gone<br />
Seein&#8217; you again has made it carry on</p>
<p>Go before you break my heart once more<br />
I know that&#8217;s what you come here for<br />
Go before you say &#8220;I love you&#8221; the way you did<br />
The day before you walked away from me</p>
<p>Lookin&#8217; back on the times we had<br />
Things were beautiful then but how quick they&#8217;ve changed<br />
One day you were in love with me<br />
Then the next, so suddenly, he came along</p>
<p>Time is meant to heal the pain I thought was gone<br />
Seein&#8217; you again has made it carry on, yeah</p>
<p>Go before you break my heart once more<br />
I know that&#8217;s what you come here for<br />
Go before you say &#8220;I love you&#8221; the way you did<br />
The day before you walked away from me</p>
<p>(Go before you break my heart once more) Just go, just go away<br />
(I know that&#8217;s what you come here for)<br />
Just leave me behind to face another day<br />
Go before you say &#8220;I love you&#8221; the way you did<br />
The day before you walked away from me</p>
<p>The day before you walked away from me</p>
