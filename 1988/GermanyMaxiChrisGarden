This is a song for you, just listen to it<br />
Because this melody is just like you<br />
Listen</p>
<p>Honest and plainspoken, tender and clever<br />
Happy and quiet and at the same time and strong enough</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s the way you are, like this song for a friend<br />
A song like you, like the way you live and dream<br />
When you hear it somewhere<br />
I miss you so</p>
<p>Friends never go too early, they never disappoint you<br />
Friends will stay when no one else remains<br />
ur pain</p>
<p>This song is for you, it&#8217;s not very much<br />
But when this song is over, a feeling remains</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s the way you are, like this song for a friend<br />
A song like you, like the way you live and dream<br />
When you hear it somewhere<br />
I miss you so<br />
