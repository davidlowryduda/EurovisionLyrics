Ooh&#8230; billions of humans on earth search the light<br />
To burn fierce fires<br />
Ooh&#8230; their ideas, which are murdered<br />
In camps, in mines, to imprison the sun</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; I know that it hurts<br />
Ooh&#8230; you see everything isn&#8217;t normal</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; in the streets and in the stations<br />
The bottom of despair of those who are cold in the winter<br />
Ooh&#8230; and all those toddlers that are mutilated<br />
For begging the useless, what do they think of the sun?</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; I know that it hurts<br />
Ooh&#8230; you see everything isn&#8217;t normal</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; what will we do with the earth<br />
When only stones are left to be launched into the universe?<br />
Ooh&#8230; if our fatal madness could finally be kept silent<br />
Let the sun shine</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; the sun<br />
Let the sun shine<br />
(Yes, the sun) Let the sun shine<br />
(Yes, the sun) Let the sun shine<br />
