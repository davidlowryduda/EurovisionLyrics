Sorry if I write you but you know with words<br />
You can&#8217;t always say what you really want<br />
It could be shyness or fear of hearing<br />
What too easily makes us suffer</p>
<p>Sorry if I write you, it&#8217;s a long time since we&#8217;ve talked<br />
Because we didn&#8217;t want to run the risk of hurting each other<br />
Who knows for how many times without even realising it<br />
We&#8217;ve walked a few meters away from each other</p>
<p>Sorry if I write you but now what remains<br />
Are some memories a picture with your name<br />
Written on the snow while you&#8217;re looking into the lens<br />
And your eyes are smiling at me and you make me feel alive</p>
<p>Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive<br />
Also without you I&#8217;ll find a reason<br />
To keep on living, living</p>
<p>Sorry if I write you but you know there&#8217;s no poetry<br />
Saying that I love you on your answering machine<br />
Probably I&#8217;m out but what I feel in my heart<br />
I don&#8217;t want on a tape where it can be removed from</p>
<p>Sorry if I write you but tell me what is left<br />
Of speaking about memories and of playing with your name<br />
It&#8217;s written on a wall without a good reason<br />
I just scream out your name, it makes me feel alive</p>
<p>Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive<br />
Also without you I&#8217;ll find a reason<br />
To keep on living, living, living<br />
