I couldn&#8217;t find the words to keep you<br />
But I&#8217;m thinking to myself<br />
Don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>When I was talking a lot of nonsense<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my voice<br />
Don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>In the darkest of summer, when the storm has fallen<br />
The forests bloom again<br />
Don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>If your heart and your body still remember<br />
One last time<br />
Don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>Love sometimes made fortresses fall down<br />
Death sometimes made the living find themselves<br />
My joy and my sadness, gone with the wind<br />
Come back to me, you, I&#8217;m waiting for you</p>
<p>You, my bread, my sun, that stole my sleep<br />
With you, give it back to me<br />
Don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>If your heart and your body still remember<br />
One last time<br />
Don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>And if my voice arrives there with you<br />
Retrace your steps, your steps, your steps<br />
Come back to me<br />
