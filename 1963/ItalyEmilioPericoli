You&#8217;re almost made for me, painted for me, Claudia<br />
But I confess that I like you most, Nadia<br />
I like everything of everyone, huhu lalala&#8230; always<br />
I can never decide, and so I&#8217;m in trouble</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of you and I see skies without clouds<br />
And a thousand mandolins are caressing me<br />
Then I open my eyes and that moment I realise that<br />
There is no one, there is no one next to me</p>
<p>In love with you, wanting you, Laura<br />
I&#8217;m not beautiful, but is it my fault, Julia?<br />
On my mouth I have, huhu lalala&#8230; kisses for you<br />
And I&#8217;m dedicating them to the first one who will say yes</p>
<p>On my mouth I have, huhu lalala&#8230; kisses for you<br />
And I&#8217;m dedicating them to the first one who will say yes</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m dedicating them to the first one who will say yes<br />
