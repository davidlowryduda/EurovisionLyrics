In the embrace of the winter night with stars without names<br />
When snow, ice and frost covers everything on earth<br />
A morning ready for dawn and night becomes day again<br />
An hour of dawn beats for my tired heart</p>
<p>When the sun has turned its course<br />
And the day has lit its lights<br />
When you are with me, then the night is over<br />
We&#8217;re humming a happy melody</p>
<p>Now we walk with spring in our minds<br />
Towards summer and heat from the sun<br />
And the days come, and the days go<br />
In the dawning spring of love</p>
<p>My own, you are so dear to me<br />
You&#8217;re the symbol of light<br />
Our winter is distant, our summer is near<br />
And you are my heart&#8217;s beloved</p>
<p>When the sun has turned its course<br />
And the day has lit its lights<br />
Our winter is distant, but our summer is near<br />
In the sparkling glow of the morning sun<br />
