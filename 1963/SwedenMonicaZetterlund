Come with me, said my friend<br />
Now the first silent winter snow falls<br />
And summer is over</p>
<p>I have a sailing boat in Lake Klara<br />
Come my friend, my boat is as white as snow<br />
Yes, come, let&#8217;s go sailing</p>
<p>Come my friend, come aboard<br />
There you can see the Riddarfj√§rd covered in white snow<br />
Out boat sails in snow</p>
<p>Yes, the Stockholm winter is a peculiar world<br />
Seagulls, in silent and beautiful snow<br />
And beautiful is the island of Stockholm</p>
<p>The bells of The German Church, silently call &#8216;ding dong&#8217;<br />
A fairytale shore, a fairytale land<br />
That meets the two of us in our boat</p>
<p>Hold my hand, hold my hand<br />
For you and me it&#8217;s still summer<br />
Come sailing with me</p>
<p>Where you and I are, there is summer<br />
Summer, it never ends<br />
Because I, I love you</p>
<p>Hold my hand, hold my hand<br />
</div>
