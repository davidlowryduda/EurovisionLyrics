A musical box<br />
A musical box<br />
From times long gone</p>
<p>There was a very little shepherdess<br />
Made of fragile white china<br />
And when the musical box tinkled<br />
Then she danced elegantly to the refrain</p>
<p>There was a shepherd facing her<br />
But he was unapproachable<br />
Because even when she asked the musical box for a dance<br />
He didn&#8217;t come closer</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t be happy either<br />
So far away from her<br />
But a fairy came softly on a spring night<br />
And touched them very carefully</p>
<p>The shepherd and his sherpherdess<br />
Are now a couple for ever<br />
And when you don&#8217;t want to believe this story<br />
Just ask that fairy yourself one day<br />
Because this fairy tale is true</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t be happy either<br />
So far away from her<br />
But a fairy came softly on a spring night<br />
And touched them very carefully</p>
<p>The shepherd and his sherpherdess<br />
Are now a couple for ever<br />
And when you don&#8217;t want to believe this story<br />
Just ask that fairy yourself one day</p>
<p>Because those two are really together now<br />
Really, this fairy tale is true<br />
