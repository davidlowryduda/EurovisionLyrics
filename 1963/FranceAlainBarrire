She was so pretty, that I didn&#8217;t dare to love her<br />
She was so pretty, I can&#8217;t forget her<br />
She was too pretty when the wind took her<br />
She escaped full of delight and the wind told me:</p>
<p>She&#8217;s very pretty, and I know you<br />
You couldn&#8217;t love her all your life<br />
Yes, but she&#8217;s gone, it&#8217;s a shame, but it&#8217;s true<br />
She was so pretty, I&#8217;ll never forget</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s autumn and I often cry<br />
Today it&#8217;s autumn and the spring is far away<br />
In the park where the leaves tremble in the ill wind<br />
Her dress swirls, then she disappears</p>
<p>She was so pretty, that I didn&#8217;t dare to love her<br />
She was so pretty, I can&#8217;t forget her<br />
She was too pretty when the wind took her<br />
She was so pretty, I&#8217;ll never forget<br />
