Love goes away<br />
And yours wouldn&#8217;t last<br />
Like the others<br />
One fine day you&#8217;re going to leave me</p>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t you<br />
It will be me who will go away<br />
Love goes away<br />
And we can&#8217;t change anything about that</p>
<p>For you as well<br />
You&#8217;re going to tell me a thousand forevers<br />
And I as well<br />
I&#8217;ll say them again in my turn</p>
<p>Love goes away<br />
I escape from you when you chase after me<br />
Or it&#8217;s me<br />
Who refuses to believe everything is finished</p>
<p>And every time<br />
Someone will always have to admit it<br />
Love goes away<br />
But without stopping, we run after<br />
