<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The language of love is often very miraculous<br />
A word, a sign, an image, a small gesture<br />
Only our heart understands that language</p>
<p>Why would the red rose exist?<br />
Are all the stars lighted every evening?<br />
Why do the butterflies flutter cheerfully?<br />
Does the bird&#8217;s choir sing in May?</p>
<p>Why can we be full of nostalgia?<br />
Why does our heart know joy and pain?<br />
Listen to the blackbird, singing happily<br />
&#8220;I love you, do you love me too?&#8221;</p>
