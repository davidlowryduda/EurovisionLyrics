A ray of sunshine in a puddle<br />
A little kiss on the cheek from a wind<br />
And the rush, humming that life&#8217;s beginning<br />
Its web in your mind</p>
<p>A whistle of silver from a treetop<br />
A faint sound of a cat grabbing<br />
A ripple in the stream, a whisper in the hedge<br />
That says, that it isn&#8217;t night anymore</p>
<p>The meadow is wet with dew<br />
Lady Dawn goes to bed<br />
Day gets up playfully<br />
And crossing the bridge of the sun</p>
<p>And the two of us? What about the two of us?<br />
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?<br />
I&#8217;m dancing and dancing and stopping and sensing only you<br />
Why ever did you run away?</p>
<p>Come back, come back<br />
Come back, you my beloved friend<br />
Come back, come back<br />
Wherever you wish, are we dancing to</p>
<p>Come, let us dance<br />
Eerything can happen<br />
Come, let us dance<br />
Let us dance, let us laugh</p>
<p>A whistle of silver from a treetop<br />
A faint sound of a cat grabbing<br />
A ripple in the stream, a whisper in the hedge<br />
That says, that it isn&#8217;t night anymore</p>
<p>The meadow is wet with dew<br />
Lady Dawn goes to bed<br />
Day gets up playfully<br />
And crossing the bridge of the sun</p>
<p>And the two of us? What about the two of us?<br />
Yes, what about the two of us, you and me?<br />
I&#8217;m dancing and dancing and stopping and sensing only you<br />
Why ever did you run away?<br />
Come back, come back</p>
<p>Beloved friend<br />
