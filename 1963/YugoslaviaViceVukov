In my neighbourhood, ships are people<br />
They cry, smile and love<br />
In my neighbourhood, ships are celebrities<br />
And the dearest toys of menacing boys</p>
<p>Ships<br />
Without you, all ports are sad<br />
Without you, rivieras are deserted<br />
Without you, seagulls die</p>
<p>While the moon cuts the night<br />
On the stem of your verse<br />
I ignite the fire of luck<br />
For your journeys</p>
<p>Ships<br />
Loves await you<br />
Windows await you<br />
Without you, guitars die</p>
<p>While dawn ignites the day<br />
On the mast of your verse<br />
I raise this song<br />
For your return</p>
<p>While dawn ignites the day<br />
On the mast of your verse<br />
I raise this song<br />
For your return</p>
<p>Oh, the dear toys<br />
From my childhood<br />
