<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
By persistently praying, every night, every day<br />
By persistently begging all the gods of love<br />
By persistenly singing your name like a poem<br />
By persistenly loving you, it will be necessary that you love me</p>
<p>By persistently praying from the depth of my heart<br />
And by despairing to find the happiness<br />
When I will have cried until my sorrow is over<br />
By persistently calling, it will be necessary that you come</p>
<p>By persistently praying and by living of hope<br />
The sun rose painfully on the fog<br />
I&#8217;m going to be able to sing, shout, shout victory<br />
My turn came, this day came<br />
By persistently praying, love, love, love<br />
