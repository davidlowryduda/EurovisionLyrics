<p>Say wonderful things to me<br />
I think you&#8217;re wonderful too<br />
Say wonderful things to me<br />
Especially &#8216;I love you&#8217; (I love you)</p>
<p>They say I was living before we met<br />
All of my yesterdays I forget<br />
Now you are the one that I&#8217;m living for<br />
And each day I love you more</p>
<p>So you must say wonderful things to me<br />
I think you&#8217;re wonderful too<br />
Say wonderful things to me<br />
Especially &#8216;I love you&#8217; (I love you)</p>
<p>The more that I see you, the more it seems<br />
People should always believe in dreams<br />
Now all of my dreams I&#8217;m dreaming of you<br />
And someday they&#8217;ll all come true</p>
<p>So you must say wonderful things to me<br />
I think you&#8217;re wonderful too<br />
Say wonderful things to me<br />
Especially &#8216;I love you&#8217; (I love you)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never hurt you or make you cry<br />
Love will grow stronger as years go by<br />
Forever you&#8217;ll be the one girl for me<br />
I&#8217;ll love you until I die</p>
<p>So you must say wonderful things to me<br />
I think you&#8217;re wonderful too<br />
Say wonderful things to me<br />
Especially &#8216;I love you&#8217;<br />
(Say wonderful things)</p>
