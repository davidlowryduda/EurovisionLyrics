Nana, nana nanana<br />
Nana nanana nana</p>
<p>When there is nothing else, I think that<br />
I still have a song I can sing to you<br />
About happiness we feel, about a road that goes<br />
Like a train on metal rails</p>
<p>To faraway stations on the North Pole<br />
Where freedom lives, and nothing else<br />
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance<br />
I want to be closer to you</p>
<p>Nothing, when there is nothing else<br />
I want to sing you a song about happiness<br />
That comes, that comes unexpectedly<br />
And takes us by the hand<br />
A song about happiness to come</p>
<p>When there is nothing else, I think that<br />
I still have the wind that runs up to the sky<br />
And the sun that rises, faraway roads that cross<br />
Seven mountains and nine seas</p>
<p>To warmer lands like birds of passage<br />
There everything is just like in a dream, but you are not there<br />
Each time when I feel miracles in the distance<br />
I want to be closer to you</p>
<p>Nothing, when there is nothing else<br />
I want to sing you a song about happiness<br />
That comes, that comes unexpectedly<br />
And takes us by the hand<br />
A song about happiness to come</p>
<p>Hey&#8230;</p>
<p>Nana, nana nanana<br />
Nana nanana nana<br />
Nana nanana nana<br />
Nanana nana, nanana nana nana</p>
<p>Nothing, when there is nothing else<br />
I want to sing you a song about happiness<br />
That comes, that comes unexpectedly<br />
And takes us by the hand<br />
A song about happiness to come</p>
<p>Nothing, when there is nothing else<br />
I want to sing you a song about happiness<br />
That comes, that comes unexpectedly<br />
And takes us by the hand<br />
A song to come</p>
<p>A song about happiness to come<br />
