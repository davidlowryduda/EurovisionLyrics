<p>I have tried every way to get to the heart of your soul<br />
&#8216;Cause everything that you deny could be there if you let me know<br />
I wanna heal every wound in you to finally make you believe</p>
<p>High, over the rain<br />
There&#8217;s still a sun that could ease all your pain<br />
I always try holding your heart<br />
Bringing you high</p>
<p>Try to make you see the light when sorrow grows deep in your mind<br />
And seize the day, not asking why there is so much for you to find<br />
I wanna bring you the wings to fly to never be broken again</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; high, over the rain<br />
There&#8217;s still a sun that could ease all your pain<br />
I always try, holding your heart<br />
Bringing you high</p>
<p>I just wanna open your closing mind<br />
Your life can&#8217;t be worth all your sacrifice<br />
There is a light over you<br />
Please let it through</p>
<p>High, over the rain<br />
There&#8217;s still a sun that could ease all your pain<br />
I always try, holding your heart<br />
Bringing you high<br />
Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>High, over the rain<br />
There&#8217;s still a sun that could ease all your pain<br />
I always try, holding your heart<br />
Bringing you high, bringing you high</p>
