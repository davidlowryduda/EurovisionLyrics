This silence that I have<br />
Every time when you are with me<br />
This pure fantasy<br />
This power that you just give</p>
<p>These little moments of luck<br />
That you so often give me<br />
That&#8217;s when words always fail me<br />
Because there is nothing without you</p>
<p>If you are sad, I&#8217;m crying along with you<br />
If you are sleeping, I&#8217;m dreaming along with you</p>
<p>You are the life that I love<br />
You have the laughter that I need<br />
You are the star on the starry sky<br />
And all the other beautiful things too</p>
<p>You are the power that surrounds me<br />
You are the warmth, you are the light<br />
And anything else that I need<br />
You are that too</p>
<p>You are a total optimist<br />
For you borders are unknown<br />
For you every wish is a goal<br />
And all dreams come true</p>
<p>If you are sad, I&#8217;m crying along with you<br />
If you are sleeping, I&#8217;m dreaming along with you</p>
<p>You are the life that I love<br />
You have the laughter that I need<br />
You are the star on the starry sky<br />
And all the other beautiful things too</p>
<p>You are the power that surrounds me<br />
You are the warmth, you are the light<br />
And anything else that I need<br />
You are that too</p>
<p>The air that gives me my breath<br />
The wonder that is called life<br />
The water that keeps me from dying of thirst<br />
You are all that in one</p>
<p>You are the life that I love<br />
You have the laughter that I need<br />
You are the star on the starry sky<br />
And all the other beautiful things too</p>
<p>You are the power that surrounds me<br />
You are the warmth, you are the light<br />
And anything else that I need<br />
You are that too<br />
