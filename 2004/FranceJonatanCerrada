There are wounds that we&#8217;ll have to forget<br />
So many deletions that we&#8217;ll have to wipe out<br />
Blowing very hard so that the rancour flies away from our hearts<br />
And then let the barriers fall one by one</p>
<p>With every step that we&#8217;ll take<br />
With every gesture that we&#8217;ll offer<br />
It will be the beginning of another tomorrow</p>
<p>In every word that we&#8217;ll say<br />
In this future that we&#8217;ll build<br />
Our hands will draw love</p>
<p>There are insults that we&#8217;ll have to forgive<br />
Cries against walls that will make them fall<br />
Let&#8217;s lay down the arms at our feet, let&#8217;s abandon our armours<br />
So that our conflicts will only be a whisper, yeah</p>
<p>With every step that we&#8217;ll take<br />
With every gesture that we&#8217;ll offer<br />
It will be the beginning of another tomorrow</p>
<p>In every word that we&#8217;ll say<br />
In this future that we&#8217;ll build<br />
Our hands will draw love</p>
<p>The battle will be long<br />
But you know, it&#8217;s worthwhile<br />
The child in us will find the way</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; there are cracks that will remain broken<br />
Slightly hard punches marked for eternity</p>
<p>With every step that we&#8217;ll take<br />
With every gesture that we&#8217;ll offer<br />
I know you&#8217;ll find in the end</p>
<p>Peace and happiness<br />
Along your path you&#8217;ll find<br />
Everything you&#8217;d like to reach</p>
<p>It&#8217;s love that our hands will draw<br />
