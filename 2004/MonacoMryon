Take care of our planet<br />
There are so many things to save<br />
The madness of people, the storms have damaged it</p>
<p>Ooh ah oh&#8230; oh&#8230; ooh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Who remembers the virgin coasts<br />
And white paradises?<br />
Who remembers the blue oceans<br />
Whales and their songs?</p>
<p>In this world where nothing more is sacred<br />
So far from our values<br />
Before the desert wipes out<br />
Our dreams of colours</p>
<p>Take care of our planet<br />
There are so many things to save<br />
May the madness of people stop<br />
May our children be able to dream</p>
<p>Their eyes turned to the stars<br />
Their hands stretched to the sky<br />
May the winds carry their sails<br />
May our steps guide their wings</p>
<p>Ooh ah whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>We have constructed prisons of glass<br />
On forests of ashes<br />
We have transformed our universe<br />
Without trying to understand it</p>
<p>On our beaches flows ink<br />
This is the blood of the earth<br />
May those who give us orders<br />
Hear our prayers</p>
<p>We dream of a paradise on earth<br />
Oh&#8230; we dream</p>
<p>Their eyes turned to the stars<br />
Their hands stretched to the sky<br />
May the winds carry their sails<br />
May our steps guide their wings</p>
<p>Take care of our planet<br />
