<p>Look at me, I need some attention<br />
I&#8217;m a girl of serious intention</p>
<p>Just like a butterfly, my wings can take me high<br />
To touch your piece of sky<br />
Though I can fly away, play cool or run away<br />
I choose to hold your love more than one night</p>
<p>You&#8217;re everything and nothing in one (What do you mean?)<br />
Our love goes from the north to the south (I disagree)<br />
I just can&#8217;t understand anymore<br />
What we have in common</p>
<p>On again, off again, like the rhythm of rain<br />
We need to decide, find an end to this game<br />
Such wonderful times, many natural highs<br />
Love is a flame that we can never tame<br />
On again, off again</p>
<p>Why, oh, why can&#8217;t I live without you?<br />
How, oh, how do I reach inside you?</p>
<p>My love is justified, I simply had enough<br />
I want you by my side<br />
Am I your fantasy, mystery or destiny?<br />
Do you take me for a ride? Please, tell me now</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the air, you&#8217;re the love that I breathe (That sounds so good)<br />
You&#8217;re the magic that flows from within (I feel that too)<br />
We come close, then we move far away<br />
Can&#8217;t we stay together?</p>
<p>On again, off again like the rhythm of rain<br />
We need to decide, find an end to this game<br />
Such wonderful times, many natural highs<br />
Love is a flame that we can never tame<br />
On again, off again</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a river between us<br />
And I need you to come across<br />
Reach out for my heart<br />
Keep this feeling so alive<br />
Love grows, we survive</p>
<p>On again, off again like the rhythm of rain<br />
We need to decide, find an end to this game<br />
Such wonderful times, many natural highs<br />
Love is a flame that we can never tame<br />
On again, off again</p>
<p>Off again, on again like a flickering flame<br />
That dies in the wind and lights up again<br />
Such wonderful times, many natural highs<br />
Love is a flame we can never tame<br />
On again, off again</p>
<p>On again, off again</p>
