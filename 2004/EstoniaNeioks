I woke up this morning at the call of the cockerel<br />
I went and left the gate open, let others follow<br />
I can&#8217;t sleep, the road runs straight ahead, we&#8217;re not going around<br />
The speed is such that I see my toes where the horizon is</p>
<p>Ravine, wood-path, over river, over hill<br />
I don&#8217;t know where life will turn<br />
Ravine, wood-path, over river, over hill<br />
I don&#8217;t know where life will turn</p>
<p>Yesterday we were here, today we came and tomorrow we&#8217;ll go again<br />
The sun shines always in our heart and we feel good wherever we are<br />
Today we came, we&#8217;re not silly, and tomorrow we&#8217;ll go again<br />
The sun shines always in our heart and we feel good wherever we are</p>
