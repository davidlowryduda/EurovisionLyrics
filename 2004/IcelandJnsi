<p>I still miss you and it makes me feel blue<br />
And I&#8217;m lost without those colours of you<br />
I can&#8217;t think straight, I just wanna be<br />
Wherever you are when you&#8217;re not here with me</p>
<p>Blend with my blue, those colours of you<br />
Please help me see it through, oh&#8230;<br />
This journey I must take alone<br />
So just blend your colours with my blue</p>
<p>I lay down and cry, and the rivers are dry<br />
Oh, to unveil my heart when you kiss me goodbye<br />
And when you set sail, fair winds all the way<br />
So farewell, that&#8217;s all I can say</p>
<p>Mmm, blend with my blue, the colours of you<br />
Oh, please help me see it through, oh&#8230;<br />
This journey I must take alone<br />
Oh, so just blend your colours with my blue</p>
<p>And I know I&#8217;ll find my love tonight<br />
I can feel you reachin&#8217; out<br />
I got this feeling deep inside<br />
It&#8217;s in my head, it&#8217;s in my heart</p>
<p>I know your love tonight<br />
And I know you&#8217;ll be by my side<br />
I know you&#8217;ll help me to see it through<br />
Oh, blend your colours with my blue</p>
