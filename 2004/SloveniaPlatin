<p>Ooh&#8230; hey yeah yeah</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s fly away, girl<br />
Up on cloud number nine I&#8217;d wish to flow<br />
You&#8217;re my most precious pearl<br />
Hmm&#8230; waiting for you, that&#8217;s all I need to know</p>
<p>Wait and see how it&#8217;s gonna be<br />
Hold my hand, just don&#8217;t let go<br />
Birds of a feather flock together<br />
But time will tell, people say, so</p>
<p>Stay forever and ever<br />
You will always be my baby<br />
Stay forever, I&#8217;ll never hurt you<br />
I won&#8217;t make you cry, no, no, no</p>
<p>Stay forever, no matter what may happen<br />
Don&#8217;t give up on me<br />
Do whatever, I&#8217;ll never let go<br />
I will catch your fall</p>
<p>Through our sunny and dark sides of life<br />
Feelings like this are made to survive<br />
What the rest of the world thinks doesn&#8217;t matter<br />
Because we know it better</p>
<p>Stay forever and ever<br />
You will always be my baby<br />
Stay forever, I&#8217;ll never hurt you<br />
I won&#8217;t make you cry, no, no, no</p>
<p>Stay forever, no matter what may happen<br />
Don&#8217;t give up on me<br />
Do whatever, I&#8217;ll never let go<br />
I will catch your fall</p>
<p>Stay forever and ever<br />
You will always be my baby, baby<br />
Stay forever, I&#8217;ll never hurt you<br />
I won&#8217;t make you cry</p>
