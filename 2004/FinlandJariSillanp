<p>Time to leave, time to feel<br />
Harp and horn, music&#8217;s born<br />
Two worlds meet<br />
Hungry sharing a fantasy</p>
<p>Tail and wing, soon will swing<br />
Dusk till dawn, let the show just begin<br />
In a place where pardon stand<br />
Giving feast on sacred land</p>
<p>The angels and devils meet at night (Hallelujah!)<br />
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight<br />
The angels and demons side by side (Hallelujah!)<br />
They dance until morning light, when nobody else is in sight<br />
Takes two to tango, tango</p>
<p>Purified, justified<br />
Times of lust (Times of lust)<br />
Times of trust (Times of trust)<br />
Praising dark for one moment in paradise</p>
<p>Passion flows, eager grows<br />
Time runs out, it&#8217;s the end of the show<br />
When the morning is at hand<br />
Time has come to show their stand</p>
<p>The angels and devils meet at night (Hallelujah!)<br />
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight<br />
The angels and demons side by side (Hallelujah!)<br />
They dance until morning light, when nobody else is in sight<br />
Takes two to tango</p>
<p>Angels falling, hear them calling<br />
Demons rising, they&#8217;re disguising<br />
Hearts are beating, secret meeting<br />
Just for the moment in love</p>
<p>The angels and devils meet at night (Ha&#8230; ha&#8230; hallelujah!)<br />
They dance, they caress each other holding on so tight<br />
The angels and demons side by side (Ha&#8230; ha&#8230; hallelujah!)<br />
They dance until morning light, when nobody else is in sight<br />
Takes two to tango</p>
