<p>As in a dream, love appeared<br />
Swept me away and made me lose control like never before<br />
As in a dream, love touched me<br />
I felt how it touched the bottom of my very soul</p>
<p>Now I know I find the key to my heart<br />
I just hope this ain&#8217;t a dream and that you are reality</p>
<p>I admit I fell for you so badly<br />
And I admit you make my senses wild<br />
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit<br />
I&#8217;ll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be in love<br />
It makes you touch the sky a thousand times or more<br />
It&#8217;s good to admit<br />
That my heart starts to race when you walk through that door</p>
<p>Now I know you are the key to my heart<br />
Just hope you&#8217;re not a dream and that you&#8217;ll be my everything</p>
<p>I admit I fell for you so badly<br />
And I admit you make my senses wild<br />
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit<br />
I&#8217;ll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine</p>
<p>I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good<br />
And I admit you make my senses wild<br />
I know sometimes I might act and look foolish, I admit, I admit<br />
I&#8217;ll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine</p>
<p>Just mine, you make me shine<br />
You are the light in my life</p>
<p>I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good<br />
And I admit you make my senses wild<br />
I know sometimes I am looking foolish, I admit, I admit<br />
I&#8217;ll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine</p>
<p>I admit I fell for you so badly, and I feel so good<br />
And I admit you make my senses wild, oh yeah<br />
I know sometimes I might act and look foolish, I admit, I admit<br />
I&#8217;ll be your fool as long as you are mine, yes mine, just mine, all right<br />
Mine, yes mine, just mine, just mine</p>
