<p>Lift me up, take me down<br />
You can turn my world around<br />
I can hear what people say<br />
It doesn&#8217;t matter anyway</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not the same, but so much alike<br />
You are my brother, my sister tonight</p>
<p>We got one life, living together<br />
In one life, let us be free<br />
One life, you take my troubles away<br />
Light up my day, yeah</p>
<p>You came here in the night<br />
Take the worries off your mind<br />
In your eyes, beneath your skin<br />
I feel the pain you&#8217;re in</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not the same, but so much alike<br />
You are my brother, my sister tonight</p>
<p>We got one life, living together<br />
In one life, let us be free<br />
One life, you take my troubles away<br />
Light up my day, yeah</p>
<p>One life, living together<br />
In one life, let us be free<br />
One life, you take my troubles away<br />
Light up my day</p>
