<p>Once again just hold me, let me feel you breathe<br />
Softly kiss me on my face, love is all I need<br />
Lonely moments, years, nothing before you<br />
Finally you&#8217;re here, our love is true</p>
<p>Hold me once again, my dear, let your passion take me<br />
In my heart there&#8217;s harmony when you&#8217;re close to me<br />
Even in my dreams, I really need to feel you<br />
Forever we&#8217;ll be one, our love is true</p>
<p>You are the only one, our love is timeless<br />
When you are by my side, I&#8217;m truly blessed with, with only happiness<br />
I have got someone, someone of my own<br />
A part of me who lives for me<br />
Who would die for me</p>
