I have no doubts, neither of us knows<br />
Why we are together tonight<br />
You don&#8217;t know my name<br />
And truly, I don&#8217;t know your name either</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s better to think about nothing<br />
Let&#8217;s make the most of being alone<br />
Let&#8217;s forget all our problems<br />
And let&#8217;s enjoy this moment</p>
<p>Tonight we&#8217;ll make it our night<br />
(Tonight&#8230; our&#8230; ah ah&#8230;)<br />
Tonight we&#8217;ll be able to be whatever we want<br />
While we wait for the sun to rise</p>
<p>I want us to be together, that we don&#8217;t stop playing<br />
I want you to tell me &#8220;I love you&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s not true<br />
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment<br />
And play&#8230; we&#8217;ll play we&#8217;re loving each other</p>
<p>And when tomorrow the sun gets you out of bed<br />
I won&#8217;t be by your side anymore<br />
You will just be a memory<br />
The dream of a midsummer night</p>
<p>That night that we both had<br />
So far from all reality<br />
A night that we&#8217;re living now<br />
And we want it to last forever</p>
<p>Where nothing matters, but us<br />
(But us&#8230; nothing matters&#8230; ah ah&#8230;)<br />
Tonight everything&#8217;s permitted, I&#8217;ll be whoever you want<br />
While the sun doesn&#8217;t turn up</p>
<p>I want us to be together, that we don&#8217;t stop playing<br />
I want you to tell me &#8220;I love you&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s not true<br />
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment</em></small><br />
And play&#8230; we&#8217;ll play we&#8217;re loving each other</p>
<p>I want us to be together, that we don&#8217;t stop playing<br />
I want you to tell me &#8220;I love you&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s not true<br />
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment<br />
And play&#8230; we&#8217;ll play we&#8217;re loving each other</p>
<p>We are not in a hurry but don&#8217;t waste time<br />
Because when the sun rises the magic will disappear<br />
The night is long but we must make the most of it<br />
I&#8217;ll be whoever you want until the sun rises<br />
Until the sun rises</p>
<p>I want us to be together, that we don&#8217;t stop playing<br />
I want you to tell me &#8220;I love you&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s not true<br />
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment<br />
And play&#8230; we&#8217;ll play we&#8217;re loving each other</p>
<p>I want us to be together, that we don&#8217;t stop playing<br />
I want you to tell me &#8220;I love you&#8221;, even though it&#8217;s not true<br />
I want us to embrace each other, that we enjoy this moment<br />
And play&#8230; we&#8217;ll play we&#8217;re loving each other</p>
<p>Until the sun rises<br />
