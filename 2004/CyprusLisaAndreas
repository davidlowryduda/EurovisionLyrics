<p>No matter where I am<br />
I&#8217;m always thinking of you<br />
It may be hard, but I need you to understand<br />
That I don&#8217;t often say what I feel<br />
But now this is straight from my heart</p>
<p>My love grows stronger every minute<br />
And it won&#8217;t ever die<br />
I want you to stay with me<br />
Not just this day, but for all my life</p>
<p>Now, when I look into your eyes<br />
I can tell there&#8217;s something wrong<br />
You&#8217;re holding back the tears<br />
Couldn&#8217;t bare to lose you now<br />
So I will make my feelings clear</p>
<p>My love grows stronger every minute<br />
And it won&#8217;t ever die<br />
You must believe I&#8217;ll always be there<br />
For you, all my life</p>
<p>Oh, please stay<br />
Mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>My love grows stronger every minute<br />
And it won&#8217;t ever die<br />
I want you to stay with me<br />
Not just this day, but for all my life</p>
<p>Oh, please stay</p>
