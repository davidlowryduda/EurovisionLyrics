She stayed crying, crying her grief<br />
And she knows that it&#8217;s for you that she&#8217;s condemned today<br />
I loved her so much, she was the blood in my veins<br />
While I didn&#8217;t know that her full moons were of another kind</p>
<p>Between your love and her pain there&#8217;s a lament<br />
Which burns me in a slow fire, which burns me in a slow fire<br />
But my chest said goodbye and now the sun shines again<br />
Because you have given fire to my heart</p>
<p>Today I was left empty to get filled with you<br />
And my shelter will be your body<br />
And my land will be your belly of wheat in bloom</p>
<p>Today I was left empty to get filled with you<br />
And my caress will be your breathing<br />
And my flag the light of your sweet love</p>
<p>(And I will love you) Until the end<br />
(I will give you) All my loving<br />
(I will love you) With all my skin and life<br />
(Everything for this love) For your love</p>
<p>(And I will love you) I will love you without borders<br />
(I will give you)<br />
I will even risk my life for this love<br />
For this love</p>
<p>She&#8217;s so far today like the footprint in sand<br />
Her memory tastes of salt and mint<br />
You give me calm in the nights I surrender to you<br />
And no one will ever erase you skin of silk</p>
<p>Between your love and her pain there&#8217;s a lament<br />
Which burns me in a slow fire, which burns me in a slow fire<br />
But my chest said goodbye and now the sun shines again<br />
Because you have given fire to my heart</p>
<p>Today I was left empty to get filled with you<br />
And my shelter will be your body<br />
And my land will be your belly of wheat in bloom</p>
<p>Today I was left empty to get filled with you<br />
And my caress will be your breathing<br />
And my flag the light of your sweet love</p>
<p>(And I will love you) I will love you without borders<br />
(I will give you) for all my life<br />
(I will love you) with everything I am<br />
Everything for this love</p>
<p>(And I will love you)<br />
(I will love you)<br />
(I will give you)<br />
(Everything for this love)</p>
<p>(And I will love you) I will love you<br />
(I will give you)<br />
Because you have given fire to my heart<br />
