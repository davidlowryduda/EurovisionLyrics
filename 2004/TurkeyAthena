<p>Oh&#8230; come on up, come on up, come on up now<br />
What you doin&#8217;, what you waitin&#8217; for?<br />
Oh&#8230; it&#8217;s time to push it, break it, rush it<br />
Don&#8217;t ever let life pass you by</p>
<p>All I know is you don&#8217;t want to be part of the crowd<br />
Realise yourself<br />
You say it but don&#8217;t feel it, what you sayin&#8217; has no meanin&#8217;<br />
Don&#8217;t hide your soul</p>
<p>For real, I&#8217;m for real<br />
Come on up</p>
<p>I wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up<br />
I wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up<br />
Do you want? Do you want?<br />
Up, I wanna bring you up, up<br />
I wanna bring you up</p>
<p>Please, please, no questions, no answers<br />
No more running around in circles<br />
Are you in? Are you out? Do you know your way out?<br />
Let me take you up in the sky</p>
<p>For real, I&#8217;m for real<br />
Come on up</p>
<p>I wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up<br />
I wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up<br />
Do you want? Do you want?<br />
Up, I wanna bring you up, up<br />
I wanna bring you up</p>
<p>I wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up<br />
I wanna bring you up, I wanna bring you up<br />
Do you want? Do you want?<br />
Up, I wanna bring you up, up<br />
I wanna bring you&#8230;</p>
<p>Come on, come on<br />
Risin&#8217; up now, risin&#8217; up now</p>
