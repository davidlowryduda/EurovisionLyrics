<p>(Nana nana nanana nana nana&#8230;)<br />
(Nana nana nanana nana na&#8230;)<br />
(Nanana nanana nana nana&#8230;)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been together for the longest time<br />
I always thought that I could read your mind<br />
But lately we&#8217;ve been like two actors in a show<br />
And I wonder, where&#8217;s the loving that we used to know?</p>
<p>I hoped that everything would be all right<br />
That you would be forever by my side<br />
But all the feelings and the luck we used to share<br />
Now it seems to me it&#8217;s gone and that you just don&#8217;t care</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my fire, you&#8217;re my desire, shame on you<br />
Can&#8217;t you see that we have gone too far?<br />
Don&#8217;t you leave me, don&#8217;t you deceive me, shame on you<br />
I just want to be where you are</p>
<p>You know I love you, though you cheat on me<br />
You try to hide it, but it&#8217;s plain to see<br />
Make up your mind, &#8217;cause I can&#8217;t take it anymore<br />
Won&#8217;t you turn to me and tell me what you&#8217;re waiting for?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my fire, you&#8217;re my desire, shame on you<br />
Can&#8217;t you see that we have gone too far?<br />
Don&#8217;t you leave me, don&#8217;t you deceive me, shame on you<br />
I just want to be where you are</p>

<p>You&#8217;re my fire, you&#8217;re my desire, shame on you<br />
Can&#8217;t you see that we have gone too far?<br />
Don&#8217;t you leave me, don&#8217;t you deceive me, shame on you<br />
I just want to be where you are</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my fire, you&#8217;re my desire, shame on you<br />
Can&#8217;t you see that we have gone too far?<br />
Don&#8217;t you leave me, don&#8217;t you deceive me, shame on you<br />
I just want to be where you are</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my fire, you&#8217;re my desire, shame on you<br />
Can&#8217;t you see that we have gone too far?<br />
Don&#8217;t you leave me, don&#8217;t you deceive me, shame on you<br />
I just want to be where you are</p>
