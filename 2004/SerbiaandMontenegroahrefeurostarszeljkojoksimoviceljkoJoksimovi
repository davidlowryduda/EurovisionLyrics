When I think of you<br />
I&#8217;m afraid of loving you again<br />
I sink my teeth into my blue lips<br />
To forget the real pain</p>
<p>My sweetheart, these days<br />
I don&#8217;t even wallow in sorrow any more<br />
I only ask if you are alone<br />
People I can&#8217;t hear</p>
<p>My sweetheart, leave tonight<br />
It&#8217;s not important, with anyone<br />
Find someone who resembles me<br />
So at least I won&#8217;t love you</p>
<p>(May someone else kiss your lips)<br />
(So I can get over you more easily)</p>
<p>My sweetheart, these days (My sweetheart)<br />
I don&#8217;t even wallow in sorrow any more (My sweetheart)<br />
I only ask if you are alone<br />
People I can&#8217;t hear</p>
<p>My sweetheart, leave tonight (My sweetheart)<br />
It&#8217;s not important, with anyone<br />
Find someone who resembles me<br />
So at least I won&#8217;t love you<br />
So I will no longer love you<br />
