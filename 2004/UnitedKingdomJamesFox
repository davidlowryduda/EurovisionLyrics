<p>Maybe I&#8217;ve been foolish letting you down<br />
I&#8217;ve been a little selfish not being around<br />
But if I lost you, I&#8217;d be helpless inside<br />
Gotta hold on to our love tonight</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause now that I&#8217;ve found that someone I believe in<br />
And I feel so complete by your side<br />
It&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve ever loved somebody, baby, in my life<br />
We gotta hold on to our love tonight</p>
<p>I know that you&#8217;ve been hurting, the pain&#8217;s in your eyes<br />
I promise you I&#8217;m changing, I feel it inside<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I would do if it all passes by<br />
We gotta hold on to our love tonight</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause now that I&#8217;ve found that someone I believe in<br />
And I feel so complete by your side<br />
It&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve ever loved somebody, baby, in my life<br />
We gotta hold on to our love tonight</p>
<p>Some things in life we should treasure<br />
When you find love, never let it go<br />
Because now I realise and I want you to know</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause now that I&#8217;ve found that someone I believe in<br />
And I feel so complete by your side<br />
It&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve ever loved somebody, baby, in my life<br />
We gotta hold on to our love tonight</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause now that I&#8217;ve found that someone I believe in<br />
And I feel so complete by your side<br />
It&#8217;s the only time I&#8217;ve ever loved somebody, baby, in my life<br />
We gotta hold on to our love tonight<br />
We gotta hold on to our love tonight</p>
