<p>What&#8217;s happened to your love?<br />
What&#8217;s happened to my love?<br />
We&#8217;ve been together for so long<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened to your love?<br />
What&#8217;s happened to my love?<br />
We&#8217;ve been together for so long<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone</p>
<p>Could you give me one more try?<br />
I will never make you cry<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ve made mistakes before<br />
Give your hand, let&#8217;s go for more</p>
<p>Oh baby, you came back again<br />
Your eyes are shining like a flame<br />
I thought that I forgot your touch<br />
But now I love you so much</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened to your love?<br />
What&#8217;s happened to my love?<br />
We&#8217;ve been together for so long<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened to your love?<br />
What&#8217;s happened to my love?<br />
We&#8217;ve been together for so long<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone</p>
<p>I do remember your first words<br />
Silence breaking down my heart<br />
I wanna dream about sky blue<br />
If I can, darling, stay with you</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s walk, we did it for the first time<br />
Along the wavy sea shoreline<br />
Please smile, you always did to me, and just to me<br />
Oh baby, tell, what do you feel?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened to your love?<br />
What&#8217;s happened to my love?<br />
We&#8217;ve been together for so long<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happened to your love?<br />
What&#8217;s happened to my love?<br />
We&#8217;ve been together for so long<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone<br />
But now the feeling&#8217;s gone</p>
