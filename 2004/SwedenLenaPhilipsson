<p>Nobody but me could know the way I feel</p>
<p>I&#8217;m standing on the rooftop and I&#8217;m crying out your name<br />
I&#8217;m looking for an answer and for somebody to blame<br />
&#8216;Cause even though it&#8217;s over you linger on my mind, oh</p>
<p>Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts<br />
In the middle of the night, in the light of the day<br />
You know that it hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts<br />
And I wish I could be stronger, no longer afraid</p>
<p>Nobody but me could know the way I feel<br />
Oh it hurts, oh it hurts</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to forget love, the pain I feel inside<br />
I&#8217;m clinging to my pillow and the tears I cannot hide<br />
I wish it could be over so I can start anew, oh</p>
<p>Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts<br />
In the middle of the night, in the light of the day<br />
You know that it hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts<br />
And I wish I could be stronger, no longer afraid</p>
<p>Nobody but me could know the way I feel<br />
Oh it hurts, oh</p>
<p>Not easy to remember and even harder to forget<br />
Whenever I surrender (Whenever I surrender)<br />
Oh, you&#8217;re always on my mind&#8230;</p>
<p>(Hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts)<br />
In the middle of the night, in the light of the day<br />
You know that it hurts, oh it hurts, really hurts<br />
And I wish I could be stronger, no longer afraid</p>
<p>Nobody but me could know the way I feel<br />
Oh it hurts, ooh it hurts<br />
I wish I could be stronger<br />
Oh, but it hurts</p>
