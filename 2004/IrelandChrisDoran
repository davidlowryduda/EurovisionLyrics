<p>I could see my future<br />
When I&#8217;m looking in your eyes<br />
And I can sense security<br />
Just by you being in my life</p>
<p>I hear a voice inside my head<br />
Says you&#8217;re an angel in disguise<br />
Without you I feel hopeless<br />
Without you I&#8217;m deprived</p>
<p>I wish I could describe it<br />
All the love I feel inside<br />
Maybe I can find the words<br />
That would make you realize</p>
<p>My life seems near perfect<br />
When I got you in my arms<br />
That&#8217;s when I feel wholesome<br />
That&#8217;s when I am with you</p>
<p>If my world stopped turning in the morning<br />
And if God should take this all away<br />
If it all should stop without a warning<br />
I would still stand tall, &#8217;cause behind it all<br />
You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s made a winner out of me</p>
<p>I lie alone to touch you<br />
And it comes as a surprise<br />
That we spend so long apart<br />
Even more that I survived</p>
<p>If I could speak frankly<br />
There&#8217;s one thing I can say<br />
That I&#8217;m falling for you, baby<br />
Falling further every day</p>
<p>And if my world stopped turning in the morning<br />
And if God should take this all away<br />
If it all should stop without a warning<br />
I would still stand tall, &#8217;cause behind it all<br />
You made me your winner</p>
<p>If my world stopped turning in the morning<br />
And if God should take this all away<br />
If it all should stop without a warning<br />
I would still stand tall, &#8217;cause behind it all<br />
You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s made a winner out of me</p>
