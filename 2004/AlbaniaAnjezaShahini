<p>How strange the feeling in your soul<br />
When love invades your very being<br />
Another &#8220;me&#8221; or so I&#8217;m told<br />
And life takes on another meaning</p>
<p>Day after day, I go through the motions<br />
Stumbling my way, life is a blur<br />
Slave of my love, of my emotions<br />
You&#8217;re in my eyes, you&#8217;re in my heart</p>
<p>One kiss, one heart, in time<br />
A kiss, the moment, is mine<br />
I close my eyes, I breathe<br />
I&#8217;m queen of the world of make believe</p>
<p>You make me feel, a little crazy<br />
You make me see, your tears are true<br />
You make my days and nights so hazy<br />
You make me feel the image of you</p>
<p>You make me feel, a little crazy<br />
You make me see, your tears are true<br />
You make my days and nights so hazy<br />
You make me feel the image of you</p>
<p>You make me feel, a little crazy<br />
You make me see</p>
<p>One kiss, one heart, in time<br />
A kiss, the moment, is mine<br />
I close my eyes, I breathe<br />
I&#8217;m queen of the world of make believe</p>
<p>You make me feel, a little crazy<br />
You make me see, your tears are true<br />
You make my days and nights so hazy<br />
You make me feel the image of you</p>
<p>You make me feel, a little crazy<br />
You make me see, your tears are true<br />
You make my days and nights so hazy<br />
You make me feel the image of you</p>
<p>You make me feel, a little crazy<br />
You make me see, your tears are true<br />
You make me feel, image of you</p>
<p>I know, it&#8217;s just, a dream<br />
I feel, l love, this life<br />
I know, it&#8217;s just, a dream<br />
I feel, l love, this life</p>
