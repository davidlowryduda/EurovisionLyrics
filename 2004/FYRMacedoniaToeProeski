<p>I saw my ID and it wasn&#8217;t me<br />
It was someone else&#8217;s identity<br />
Why do I need to prove myself?<br />
Who is the judge of my sanity?</p>
<p>Roaming through my old emotions<br />
I find new feelings of misery<br />
I bet with my soul to get back the truth<br />
Where I will face reality</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
<p>Walking around with some thoughts on my mind<br />
I&#8217;ve searched for a place where I&#8217;ll be free<br />
From all that I said and all that&#8217;s been done<br />
It&#8217;ll be hard to find it inside of me</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
<p>I know that I&#8217;ve gotta try<br />
No one can see me cry<br />
I can&#8217;t take it any more<br />
I must find a way to let myself go</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
<p>Life is a book and you gotta read it<br />
Life is a story and you gotta tell it<br />
Life is a song and you gotta sing it<br />
You got to know how to live it</p>
