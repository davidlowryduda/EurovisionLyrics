<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
You have frozen up the sea, the crazy waves<br />
And hidden the pores, the first sweetest pores, from me</p>
<p>Where are you blue-eyed, my life&#8217;s miserable<br />
Does someone love your heart away from me<br />
I still wear the old jumper you&#8217;ve knitted for me<br />
And forever split my heart</p>
<p>When streets are quiet and tramways asleep<br />
And when the thick fog is swallowing me<br />
Only half the heart is pounding, half&#8217;s with you<br />
When we give life everything, it eats us alive</p>
<p>The 21st century is coming, my dear<br />
And you&#8217;re nowhere to be found<br />
The 21st century is coming, my dear<br />
And happiness is nowhere to be found<br />
And happiness is nowhere to be found</p>
<p>The breakfast is in bed, but love is outside it<br />
Farewell with you is most horrific<br />
Your light&#8217;s still on, like an everlasting lighthouse<br />
Why was I born, when I lose everything I own</p>
<p>When you light up the stars, quietness sings<br />
Do you know how much I miss you<br />
My life is worth nothing<br />
It&#8217;s decaying, like the old blue jeans</p>
<p>The 21st century is coming, my dear<br />
And you&#8217;re nowhere to be found<br />
The 21st century is coming, my dear<br />
And happiness is nowhere to be found<br />
And happiness is nowhere to be found<br />
