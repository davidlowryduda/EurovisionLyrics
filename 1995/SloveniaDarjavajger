Listen to me, look at me embraced<br />
Trust me when the night hides you<br />
Admit that you too<br />
Would kiss the sun and dream</p>
<p>You are in me, you&#8217;re accompanying me in the wind<br />
Now, only your voice is waking up<br />
You&#8217;re woven in a ray<br />
You&#8217;re like a night, a touch of stars<br />
You hide, glimmering in me</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s trust that there is just one sky<br />
You are in it, my traces are within you<br />
Let&#8217;s confess what we keep in us<br />
Everything is verse, everything is a touch of love</p>
<p>We pray for time<br />
Paths, moments of joy<br />
We plea for this night<br />
This dream of eternity<br />
There&#8217;s me and you in it</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s trust that there is just one sky<br />
You are in it, my traces are within you<br />
Let&#8217;s confess what we keep in us<br />
Everything is verse, everything is a touch of love<br />
Everything is verse, everything is a touch of love<br />
