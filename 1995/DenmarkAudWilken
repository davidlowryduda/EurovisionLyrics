Let me know when<br />
All the trains are leaving<br />
&#8216;Cause I want to wake up with you<br />
Now the snow has incarcerated me</p>
<p>Just a winter away<br />
Cold and clear as ice<br />
Send your thoughts to me<br />
&#8216;Cause my heart is pounding</p>
<p>From Mols to Skagen, from Mols to Skagen<br />
From Mols to Skagen, I&#8217;m missing you</p>
<p>And your silky sheets<br />
And breakfast on blue balconies<br />
There will be no wild swans<br />
As long as this snow keeps falling</p>
<p>You were everything to me<br />
Now I am quiet and pale<br />
You are the Emperor of the Sun<br />
My dreams are soaring</p>
<p>From Mols to Skagen, from Mols to Skagen<br />
From Mols to Skagen, I&#8217;m missing you</p>
<p>And your silky sheets<br />
And breakfast on blue balconies<br />
There will be no wild swans<br />
As long as this snow keeps falling</p>
<p>Silky sheets<br />
And breakfast on blue balconies<br />
There will be no wild swans<br />
As long as this snow keeps falling</p>
<p>Silky sheets (From Mols to Skagen)<br />
And breakfast on blue balconies (From Mols to Skagen)<br />
There will be no wild swans<br />
As long as this snow keeps falling<br />
