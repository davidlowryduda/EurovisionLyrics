<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
When your journey is long and you are weary<br />
But you still have to go on, mmm&#8230;<br />
And when the shadows start to grow and come to life<br />
And when the night scares you so</p>
<p>I am beside you and I follow every step you take<br />
And with you I&#8217;ll stay</p>
<p>So look at me, oho&#8230; a haven in the storm<br />
Like a wave, that is born to carry you<br />
Yes, look at me, oho&#8230; in light and darkness<br />
I&#8217;ll be there and I&#8217;ll never leave you</p>
<p>When you stand one day at a crossroads of your life<br />
Like a lost little child<br />
I am beside you and I follow every step you take<br />
And I&#8217;ll stay with you</p>
<p>So look at me, oho&#8230; a haven in the storm<br />
Like a wave, that is born to carry you<br />
Yes, look at me, oho&#8230; in light and darkness<br />
I&#8217;ll be there and I&#8217;ll never leave you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go with you wherever you go<br />
And I&#8217;ll never leave you</p>
<p>So look at me, oho&#8230; a haven in the storm<br />
Like a wave, that is born to love you<br />
Yes, look at me, when the light turns into darkness in your life<br />
I&#8217;ll be there, and I&#8217;ll never leave you<br />
Love you so<br />
