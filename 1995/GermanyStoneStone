Sometimes when I&#8217;m helpless<br />
And my belief has lost its way<br />
The grief burns deep inside of me<br />
I&#8217;m only hunting after dreams</p>
<p>Is my life endlessly empty?<br />
Finding no more peace<br />
Longing cries â€“ safety<br />
But You are here beside me<br />
Hey&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you know this feeling?<br />
You&#8217;re alone and your soul freezes<br />
It&#8217;s so difficult to be a human being<br />
Trust in Your angel deep inside of You</p>
<p>Believe me, I&#8217;m loyal to You<br />
You are the only reason for that<br />
I feel You near, so near to me<br />
You catch all my tears</p>
<p>Oh Lord, I&#8217;m in love with You<br />
Can&#8217;t restrain myself, can&#8217;t explain<br />
What happens between heaven and earth</p>
<p>Oh Lord, I&#8217;m in love with You<br />
Can&#8217;t restrain myself, can&#8217;t explain<br />
Memory stays and tells about You<br />
Only You are the reason for that</p>
<p>Fear, I let you pass away<br />
I recognised you often enough<br />
I know now that nothing can happen to me<br />
I carry a heart full of light inside of me</p>
<p>Silent night, I trust in You<br />
There are no more doubts for me<br />
I can never lose You<br />
A dream becomes true, just with You</p>
<p>Oh Lord, I&#8217;m in love with You<br />
Can&#8217;t restrain myself, can&#8217;t explain<br />
What happens between heaven and earth</p>
<p>Oh Lord, I&#8217;m in love with You<br />
Can&#8217;t restrain myself, can&#8217;t explain<br />
Memory stays and tells about You<br />
Only You are the reason for that</p>
<p>You can see my soul<br />
All the light inside me belongs to You</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; I&#8217;m in love with You<br />
Can&#8217;t restrain myself, can&#8217;t explain<br />
What happens between heaven and earth<br />
I&#8217;m so in love with You (I&#8217;m so in love with You)<br />
I&#8217;m so in love with You (I&#8217;m so in love&#8230;)<br />
