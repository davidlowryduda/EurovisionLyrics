<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Life throws me off course when you look at me<br />
And then your hand touches me<br />
It&#8217;s away from the very moment<br />
When your kiss seduced me</p>
<p>Every norm is the same to me<br />
And madness becomes normal</p>
<p>The old world turns the wrong way<br />
Be light like a feather and float away<br />
Gold and platinum will have no value<br />
I&#8217;m a millionaire when you are with me<br />
Laughter and crying unites</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; yeah yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Make a clown out of me, you acrobat without rope<br />
Fly with me through time<br />
Let&#8217;s build a house out of daydreams<br />
Truth or false, no problems around</p>
<p>Every norm is the same to me<br />
And madness becomes normal, becomes normal&#8230;</p>
<p>(The old world turns the wrong way)<br />
Ah&#8230; be light like a feather and float away<br />
Gold and platinum will have no value<br />
I&#8217;m a millionaire, and live on it</p>
<p>The old world turns the wrong way<br />
Be light like a feather when I&#8217;m with you<br />
Laughter and crying united</p>
<p>Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
The world turns the wrong way<br />
