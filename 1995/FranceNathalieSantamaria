His three bunches of flowers at the door of my home<br />
A poem written for me as lyrics of a song<br />
His voice at the answering machine round four in the morning<br />
Tells me: &#8220;My sweetheart, lots of kisses, everything&#8217;s fine&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for him, a bit like a thief waiting for the good hour<br />
I have the idea that this man is a sweetie or a charmer</p>
<p>He makes a date with me, often he tells me politely<br />
&#8220;If you will permit me, miss&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To put a kiss, a jewel on your neck&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Something eternal&#8221;</p>
<p>He makes a date with me, then I admit<br />
That I feel wings growing on me<br />
And the Good Lord is jealous of this angel who is a bit crazy<br />
It makes me believe in heaven</p>
<p>He makes a date with me as if he would give his life<br />
Before him, I&#8217;ve always been on first-name terms</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an airline ticket bound for the Marquesas Islands<br />
Because I&#8217;ve said no to New York and Venice<br />
It&#8217;s a big limousine parked at the bottom of the elevator<br />
He&#8217;s also capable to disguise himself as a chauffeur</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a bit dandy, a bit hooligan, a bit crazy<br />
But I am, as they say, the singer of his dance band</p>
<p>He makes a date with me, often he tells me politely<br />
&#8220;If you will permit me, miss&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To put a kiss, a jewel on your neck&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Something eternal&#8221;</p>
<p>He makes a date with me, then I admit<br />
That I feel wings growing on me<br />
And the Good Lord is jealous of this angel who is a bit crazy<br />
It makes me believe in heaven</p>
<p>He makes a date with me as if he would give his life<br />
Before him, I&#8217;ve always been on first-name terms</p>
<p>He makes a date with me, often he tells me politely<br />
&#8220;If you will permit me, miss&#8221;<br />
&#8220;To put a kiss, a jewel on your neck&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Something eternal&#8221;</p>
<p>He makes a date with me, then I admit<br />
That I feel wings growing on me<br />
And the Good Lord is jealous of this angel who is a bit crazy<br />
It makes me believe in heaven</p>
<p>It makes me believe in heaven<br />
It makes me believe in heaven<br />
