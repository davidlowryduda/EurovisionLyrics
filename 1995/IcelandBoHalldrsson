Now, if you want, the night will love you body and soul<br />
Now, if you want, it will carry your secrets from your lips<br />
Now, if you want, love will touch your eyes so deep and blue, yes<br />
Now, if you want, we will love and desire</p>
<p>Oh, I know that all things come to an end, rain falls on green woods<br />
And while you&#8217;re with me, I want to love you a lot<br />
This night is ours, this kiss is for you<br />
It will shed light on your tears, when in the morning I depart</p>
<p>Now, if you want, the night will love you body and soul<br />
Now, if you want, it will carry your secrets from your lips<br />
Now, if you want, love will touch your eyes so deep and blue, yes<br />
Now, if you want (We will love and desire)<br />
We will love and desire, yes</p>
<p>Now, if you want, the night will love you body and soul<br />
Now, if you want, it will carry your secrets from your lips<br />
Oh, now, if you want, love will touch your eyes so deep and blue, yes<br />
Now, if you want, we will love and desire</p>
<p>Now, if you want, we will love and desire<br />
