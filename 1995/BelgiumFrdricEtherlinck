The voice is free, free of everything<br />
Everything is possible and we don&#8217;t give a damn<br />
Balanced on our knees<br />
The voice is free, free of everything</p>
<p>The voice is free, free of everything<br />
Everything is possible and we don&#8217;t give a damn<br />
Take yourself as target, carry on<br />
The voice is free, free of everything</p>
<p>Free to cry out your dreams when you wake up in the morning<br />
To imagine that you have a duel with your reflection<br />
Look yourself in the eyes and talk to whom you want<br />
You didn&#8217;t wake up for nothing, it&#8217;s fine already</p>
<p>The voice is free, free of everything<br />
Everything is possible and we don&#8217;t give a damn<br />
Balanced on our knees<br />
The voice is free, free of everything</p>
<p>Free to wipe out your screen of those black and bloody pictures<br />
You can change the colours that scare you<br />
(Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230;)<br />
When you run down the street, if they didn&#8217;t recognise you<br />
You didn&#8217;t cry out loud enough, try again</p>
<p>The voice is free, free of everything<br />
Everything is possible and we don&#8217;t give a damn<br />
Balanced on our knees<br />
The voice is free, free of everything</p>
<p>The voice is free, free of everything<br />
Everything is possible and you don&#8217;t give a damn<br />
Each person has his own written bible<br />
The voice is free, free of everything<br />
