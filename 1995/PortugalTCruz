Who are these people, yours and mine<br />
Whom had spread roots wherever they went?<br />
They changed the sea, they changed the sky<br />
Where there was no dawn<br />
They made the world their country</p>
<p>Your grandfather was in these parts<br />
My grandmother was here too<br />
Our love is the entire ocean<br />
Your perfume is moonlight<br />
My taste is coffee</p>
<p>My sweetheart with white skin<br />
You are the cream in my dark tea<br />
It&#8217;s sweeter than honey<br />
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate</p>
<p>A white seagull was found<br />
In those southern lands<br />
Sweet and musical people<br />
Whose tropical singing<br />
Made the dream and the sea blue</p>
<p>Who flavoured our love<br />
Made by the Spanish and Portuguese guitar<br />
In the to-and-fro of caravels<br />
With pepper and cinnamon<br />
With chilli and saffron?</p>
<p>My sweetheart with white skin<br />
You are the cream in my dark tea<br />
It&#8217;s sweeter than honey<br />
A mixture of vanilla and chocolate</p>
<p>Who were those people who lifted anchor<br />
And rounded Cape Bojador?<br />
Those people who fell under the spell, the challenge<br />
To invent a new love</p>
<p>When hands are joined, a flower is born<br />
And each kiss is blissful peace<br />
When our souls feel love<br />
Whatever the colour of our body<br />
Black or white is of no importance</p>
<p>When our souls feel love<br />
Whatever the colour of our body<br />
Black or white is of no importance<br />
