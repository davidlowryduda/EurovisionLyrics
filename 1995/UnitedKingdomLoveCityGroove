<p>Ooh, baby, you know how I been feelin&#8217;<br />
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe, ooh babe)<br />
Ooh, baby, you know how I been feelin&#8217;<br />
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe, ooh babe)<br />
Uh&#8230;</p>
<p>Baby, baby, baby, you got me goin&#8217; crazy<br />
I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; kinda high, my mind is gettin&#8217; hazy<br />
But when I think of you, I know just what to do<br />
You make me feel so happy when I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; blue</p>
<p>You&#8217;re pickin&#8217; me up with a kiss, a touch o&#8217; your hand<br />
You&#8217;re all that I want, you&#8217;re everything I planned<br />
Like a fairy tale story, you&#8217;re the man o&#8217; my dreams<br />
My knight in shining armour, well, that&#8217;s how it seems</p>
<p>You greet me in the morning with a kiss and a smile<br />
And for the rest of the day I&#8217;m on cloud nine<br />
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe&#8230;)<br />
It may sound like fantasy, but to me, it&#8217;s real<br />
And I could trust my emotions &#8217;cause I know what I feel</p>
<p>What we have is special, and that it would last<br />
Our hearts beaten as one, it&#8217;s pumpin&#8217; blood real fast<br />
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe&#8230;)<br />
&#8216;Cause the connection is truly from above<br />
And I thank God</p>
<p>In the mornin&#8217; when the sun shines down on your body<br />
I know we&#8217;re really makin&#8217; love now<br />
In the mornin&#8217; when the sun shines down on your body<br />
I know we&#8217;re really makin&#8217; love now</p>
<p>Now baby, baby, when I first saw your face<br />
I saw you had flavour and I wanted a taste of this sweet thing<br />
But now there&#8217;s so much more<br />
&#8216;Cause everyday I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; about what my baby has in store</p>
<p>Trust and believe, day to day, you never doubt her<br />
&#8216;Cause I used to have a dream girl, but now I found her<br />
And she&#8217;s by my side, she&#8217;s my pride, my all<br />
Ten foot tall, that&#8217;s how I feel, I never fall, I never fell</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; what the hell, I&#8217;ll admit it<br />
Love was the target and you hit it<br />
So as I watch you sleep in the middle of the night<br />
You open your eyes and I know it&#8217;s so right</p>
<p>Two hearts, two minds, two people, one love<br />
And the way you&#8217;re makin&#8217; me feel<br />
It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re sent from up above<br />
(Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh ooh ooh babe&#8230;)</p>
<p>Your touch, your smell, your face, a unique breed<br />
It&#8217;s only love but it&#8217;s all that I need</p>
<p>In the mornin&#8217; when the sun shines down on your body<br />

Keepin&#8217; me lost for words, yeah, I know how that sounds<br />
Now I been to many places and I seen many things<br />
But nothin&#8217; that I know can ever make my heart sing like you do</p>
