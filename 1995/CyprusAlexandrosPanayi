I start my path with a shout<br />
And I take my hand to the fire<br />
Wise men&#8217;s prophecies<br />
Told me that I would be pierced with pins</p>
<p>With my grey uniform I learnt<br />
To love the Holy God<br />
I change the truth<br />
And I walk ahead strongly</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t believe yet (I do not stop)<br />
I changed the rules (I will find reasons)<br />
I&#8217;m the Greek who fights (Fights)</p>
<p>They said I lost my way (I do not stop)<br />
They opened me paths (I will find reasons)<br />
I remained alone, but I lived again, I lived in the fire</p>
<p>The fire which burns my soul<br />
It&#8217;s always about to be extinguished<br />
By a bitter honey<br />
Which falls like rain</p>
<p>But I went ahead (I do not stop)<br />
I didn&#8217;t listen to their words (I will find reasons)<br />
I&#8217;m the Greek who goes ahead (Goes ahead)</p>
<p>They told me not to ask (I do not stop)<br />
The told me not to look for reasons (I will find reasons)<br />
I lived alone in the fire (In the fire)</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t believe yet (I do not stop)<br />
I changed the rules (I will find reasons)<br />
I&#8217;m the Greek who fights (Fights)</p>
<p>They said I lost my way (I do not stop)<br />
They opened me paths (I will find reasons)<br />
I remained alone, but I lived again, I lived in the fire</p>
<p>(I do not stop, I will find reasons)<br />
I&#8217;m the Greek who fights (Fights)</p>
<p>They said I lost my way (I do not stop)<br />
They opened me paths (I will find reasons)<br />
I remained alone, but I lived again, I lived in the fire</p>
<p>In the fire<br />
