I&#8217;ve felt the emptiness<br />
And a sleeping memory arouses again<br />
You&#8217;re not with me<br />
And so much loneliness is hurting me inside<br />
Who knows where you are?<br />
Who knows where you are?</p>
<p>Come, come, come back to me<br />
Come, come, because I need your love<br />
Come, I can&#8217;t forget you<br />
Come back to me, my love</p>
<p>Nothing remains in my soul<br />
Except for this flame that will never die<br />
That burns in my chest<br />
When, alone in my bed, I feel you&#8217;re not there</p>
<p>You have to listen to me<br />
You have to listen to me</p>
<p>Come, come, come back to me<br />
Come, come, because I need your love<br />
Come, come back to me<br />
Give heat to this winter</p>
<p>Come, come, come back to me<br />
Come, come, I&#8217;ve already asked your forgiveness<br />
(Come) Come, I can&#8217;t forget you<br />
Come back to me, my love</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; (Come, come, come back to me)<br />
(Come, come, because I need your love)<br />
Come, come, come (Come, come, come back to me)<br />
(Give this winter heat) Oh, yeah, yeah</p>
<p>Come, come, come back to me<br />
Come, come, I&#8217;ve already asked your forgiveness<br />
(Come) Come, I can&#8217;t forget you<br />
Come back to me, my love<br />
