The hall is slowly getting darker<br />
The auditorium is already crowded<br />
Faces down there in the semi-darkness<br />
I&#8217;m looking, maybe you have come</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m afraid<br />
Wherever you are, you&#8217;re lost in the crowd<br />
If you are here<br />
If I don&#8217;t see you now, I don&#8217;t know<br />
When there will be another chance</p>
<p>Yesterday some friends told me<br />
Some words about you<br />
You went through bad times<br />
When everything was the same</p>
<p>We already called you<br />
But at the old number that I knew<br />
Somebody else answered or nobody<br />
Are you staying or living somewhere else?<br />
When we meet, you have to tell me everything</p>
<p>A new name on the old house wall<br />
A new year, maybe it will be easier<br />
Another photograph on a new page of the album</p>
<p>A new name on the old house wall<br />
A new year, maybe it will be easier<br />
Otherwise everything would be more incomprehensible</p>
<p>A new name on the old house wall<br />
A new year, maybe it will be easier<br />
Another photograph on a new page of the album<br />
A new name&#8230;<br />
