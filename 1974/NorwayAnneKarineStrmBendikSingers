<p>And today is the first day of living<br />
&#8216;Understanding&#8217; &#8211; the word of the day<br />
So with faith in the things we believe in<br />
There will always be help on the way</p>
<p>We are changing the tide every hour<br />
We are clearing the sky up above<br />
And we know that with our newborn power<br />
Every day is the first day of love</p>
<p>In our song &#8211; the final solution<br />
We have used the words on the wall<br />
Awaiting the love revolution<br />
We all know the curtain will fall</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you feel the silent ovation?<br />
Don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s only the start?<br />
In tune with your own generation<br />
You are finding love in your heart</p>
<p>And today is the first day of living<br />
&#8216;Understanding&#8217; &#8211; the word of the day<br />
So, with faith in the things we believe in<br />
There will always be help on the way</p>
<p>We are changing the tide every hour<br />
We are clearing the sky up above<br />
And we know that with our newborn power<br />
Every day is the first day of love</p>
<p>Even though we&#8217;re at the beginning<br />
We are going down the same road<br />
At last we can say we are winning<br />
We have help to carry our load</p>
<p>And today is the first day of living<br />
&#8216;Understanding&#8217; &#8211; the word of the day<br />
So, with faith in the things we believe in<br />
There will always be help on the way</p>
<p>We are changing the tide every hour<br />
We are clearing the sky up above<br />
And we know that with our newborn power<br />
Every day is the first day of love</p>
