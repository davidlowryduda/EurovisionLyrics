<p>Back in the first days of history<br />
When the world existed only in theory<br />
Tomorrow, yesterday and the day before were all the same<br />
They used to fight over where the sun should be</p>
<p>But one thing was agreed upon<br />
If one is stubborn<br />
There&#8217;s no chance, there&#8217;s no compensation<br />
That&#8217;s what happened</p>
<p>I gave her my life, I went down on my knees<br />
Believe me, everybody<br />
I learnt what for nothing is and I was offended</p>
<p>Since then many bridges have crossed over the water<br />
And they managed to invent noon<br />
They didn&#8217;t know yet about the globe and what&#8217;s it shaped like<br />
Whether it&#8217;s square, round, or however it feels like</p>
<p>But one thing they knew<br />
And this they immediately established<br />
If she refused &#8211; there&#8217;s no hope<br />
That&#8217;s what happened</p>
<p>I gave her my life, I went down on my knees<br />
Believe me, everybody<br />
I learnt what for nothing is and I was offended</p>
<p>Today you&#8217;ll find that the subject of every argument<br />
Is what came first &#8211; the egg or the apple?<br />
One says that he&#8217;s running out of sky<br />
When there&#8217;s enough air for a country or two</p>
<p>Maybe we&#8217;ll get along after all<br />
She&#8217;ll want it, then we&#8217;ll get over it<br />
She denied any access<br />
That&#8217;s what happened when</p>
<p>I gave her my life, I went down on my knees<br />
Believe me, everybody, I learned what for nothing is<br />
I gave her my life, I went down on my knees<br />
Believe me, everybody, I learned what for nothing is</p>
<p>I gave her my life, I went down on my knees<br />
Believe me, everybody, I learned what for nothing is<br />
I gave her, I gave her<br />
I gave her my life<br />
