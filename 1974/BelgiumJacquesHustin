Come back to earth, flower of liberty<br />
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners<br />
There&#8217;s a lot to do and a lot to love<br />
Come back to earth, flower of liberty</p>
<p>Is it really a child of the Good Lord<br />
That I saw passing by this morning?<br />
He already looked like a little old man<br />
Who doesn&#8217;t expect anything of the next day</p>
<p>Was it really a man I was talking to?<br />
He looked at me without seeing me<br />
Although nothing else seperated us<br />
But the gratings of a counter</p>
<p>Come back to earth, flower of liberty<br />
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners<br />
There&#8217;s a lot to do and a lot to love<br />
Come back to earth, flower of liberty</p>
<p>You who were the princess of the wind<br />
Is it good to live here<br />
In this palace of glass and cement<br />
Where the trees are the enemy?</p>
<p>You have your fingers clenched on the future<br />
Without seeing that the present is dead<br />
The hour has come for me to leave again<br />
This evening I&#8217;ll still be alone</p>
<p>Come back to earth, flower of liberty<br />
Come back to earth, our hearts are prisonners<br />
There&#8217;s a lot to do and a lot to love<br />
Come back to earth, flower of liberty</p>
<p>Come back to earth, flower of liberty<br />
Come back to the earth, our hearts are prisonners<br />
There&#8217;s a lot to do and a lot to love<br />
Come back to earth, flower of liberty<br />
