I wanted to know who I was, what I&#8217;m doing here<br />
Who has abandoned me, whom I forgot<br />
I asked myself, I wanted to know about us<br />
But the sea doesn&#8217;t bring me your voice</p>
<p>In silence, my love, in sadness at last<br />
I feel you like a flower, I feel you hurting me<br />
I remember you, leaving is dying<br />
Like loving is winning and losing</p>
<p>You came as a flower that I have picked<br />
You gave me your love, I gave you nothing<br />
In your body, my love, I fell asleep<br />
I&#8217;ve died in it and after dying I was reborn</p>
<p>And after love, and after us<br />
Saying goodbye, staying alone<br />
Your empty place, your absence in me<br />
Your peace that I lost, my sorrow that I gained<br />
Again you came as a flower that I picked</p>
<p>And after love, and after us<br />
Saying goodbye, staying alone<br />
