<p>Long, long live love<br />
Love is to care<br />
Caring and sharing<br />
Long, long live love</p>
<p>All the kids, like ten tin soldiers<br />
In a row follow hand in hand<br />
Sister Anna, carrying the banner<br />
For the Sally Annie Band</p>
<p>Singing songs of praise and glory<br />
We all learned to love their story<br />
Good things are comin&#8217; to ya<br />
Glory, glory, hallelujah</p>
<p>Long, long live love<br />
As long as we live<br />
Living for giving<br />
Long, long live love</p>
<p>On a wet day, dry day, great to be alive day<br />
Brother takes the stand<br />
Cymbals ringing, everybody singing<br />
With the Sally Annie Band</p>
<p>Just a band of happy people<br />
Teachin&#8217;, preachin&#8217; love is equal<br />
When you feel the spirit move ya<br />
Glory, glory, hallelujah</p>
<p>Long, long live love<br />
Love is to care<br />
Caring and sharing, long<br />
Long live love, love, love, love, love</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; long, long live love<br />
As long as we live<br />
Living for giving<br />
Long, long live love</p>
