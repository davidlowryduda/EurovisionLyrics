<p>In the alleys children are singing, I come out on the balcony<br />
The moon throws golden light on the street, I come out and drown in it<br />
But I&#8217;m satisfied, satisfied, satisfied with having<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend</p>
<p>As a door to the light, yearning is my brother<br />
And God gives me<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend</p>
<p>The world runs, asking for love, honour and money<br />
And the bouzouki doesn&#8217;t stop weeping during the night<br />
But for me, for me, for me, it&#8217;s enough to have<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend</p>
<p>As a door to the light, yearning is my brother<br />
And God gives me<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend</p>
<p>Lala lala lalala lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lalala lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lalala lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend</p>
<p>A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
A bit of wine, a bit of sea and my boyfriend<br />
