<p>My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender<br />
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way<br />
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself</p>
<p>Waterloo &#8211; I was defeated, you won the war<br />
Waterloo &#8211; promise to love you for ever more<br />
Waterloo &#8211; couldn&#8217;t escape if I wanted to<br />
Waterloo &#8211; knowing my fate is to be with you<br />
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo &#8211; finally facing my Waterloo</p>
<p>My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger<br />
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight<br />
And how could I ever refuse?<br />
I feel like I win when I lose</p>
<p>Waterloo &#8211; I was defeated, you won the war<br />
Waterloo &#8211; promise to love you for ever more<br />
Waterloo &#8211; couldn&#8217;t escape if I wanted to<br />
Waterloo &#8211; knowing my fate is to be with you<br />
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo &#8211; finally facing my Waterloo</p>
<p>So how could I ever refuse?<br />
I feel like I win when I lose</p>
<p>Waterloo &#8211; couldn&#8217;t escape if I wanted to<br />
Waterloo &#8211; knowing my fate is to be with you<br />
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo &#8211; finally facing my Waterloo<br />
Ooh&#8230; Waterloo &#8211; knowing my fate is to be with you<br />
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo &#8211; finally facing my Waterloo</p>
