I didn&#8217;t really speak French<br />
When we both got to know each other<br />
From your side, you don&#8217;t say a word of English<br />
But you guessed in my eyes, and we were happy</p>
<p>All dreams are allowed, although I leave you tonight<br />
Your heart changed so quickly that our dreams have ended</p>
<p>Bye bye, I love you, love you<br />
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling<br />
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me<br />
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you</p>
<p>All dreams are allowed, I loved you, I trusted you<br />
I waited for the existence of what you promised me<br />
All dreams are allowed, you haven&#8217;t been loyal<br />
You made me cry for her, you lied to me too many times</p>
<p>Bye bye, I love you, love you<br />
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling<br />
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me<br />
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you</p>
<p>Bye bye, I love you, love you<br />
It was the most beautiful summer in my life, I love you, darling<br />
My hurt heart, I leave, letting behind me<br />
So much sorrow, so many days, so much love with you</p>
<p>But to share us, be sorry and love you like before<br />
But to share us, be sorry and love each other like before<br />
