Today I wrote to you it&#8217;s over<br />
But still you&#8217;re here and I&#8217;m glad<br />
I shouldn&#8217;t love you anymore<br />
You&#8217;re not free and I must go, I must go</p>
<p>I saw in your face what you are hiding<br />
Because also your heart has lost its way<br />
And no one knows what will happen now</p>
<p>The summer melody<br />
It&#8217;s just a delusion<br />
We&#8217;re both in love<br />
But that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s supposed to be for us</p>
<p>The summer melody<br />
It says that you&#8217;re not free<br />
And this time of roses will once be over</p>
<p>We often see each other again, and our dream<br />
It is so beautiful, but unfortunately not true<br />
And this song of love sounds throughout the room<br />
We&#8217;re a couple, mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>The summer melody<br />
It&#8217;s just a delusion<br />
We&#8217;re both in love<br />
But that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s supposed to be for us</p>
<p>The summer melody<br />
It says that you&#8217;re not free<br />
And this time of roses will once be over</p>
<p>(The summer melody) The summer melody<br />
(It&#8217;s just a daydream) It&#8217;s just a delusion<br />
And this time of roses will once be over<br />
