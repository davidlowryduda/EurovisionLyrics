I walked a little, following his steps<br />
And who knows why I wasn&#8217;t laughing anymore<br />
The grass leaned upon my dress<br />
It was as if I was saying goodbye</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t read my thoughts anymore<br />
But then the atmosphere cleared up<br />
And I had to say yes to him</p>
<p>Yes, my mind said yes<br />
Out of fear or out of love<br />
I never asked myself about it</p>
<p>Yes, I softly said yes<br />
To feel an emotion<br />
That I&#8217;ve never had before</p>
<p>And when in his face<br />
The whole sky cleared up<br />
Yes, yes</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember anymore what happened after that<br />
Maybe I woke up or I fell asleep<br />
And in my dreams, there were wide prairies<br />
And your hands were holding mine</p>
<p>We ran and then, we ran and then<br />
And then the atmosphere cleared up<br />
And I said yes to you once again</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Yes, I softly said yes<br />
To feel an emotion<br />
That I&#8217;ve never had before</p>
<p>And when in his face<br />
The whole sky cleared up</p>
<p>Yes (I said yes to love)<br />
(And I would say yes to you every night like then)<br />
Yes, yes<br />
