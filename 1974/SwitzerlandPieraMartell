Desire to the past<br />
And the memory to our luck<br />
Play a wild game with me<br />
And every moment in time<br />
I take them back from oblivion</p>
<p>My call for you will be a cry of love<br />
That&#8217;s why the wind sings the song of desire<br />
My call for you will be like a sunbeam<br />
That makes our love bloom again</p>
<p>Questions if my life&#8217;s worthy<br />
If it goes on without you<br />
Days that are nothing but dreams<br />
My life is an empty space<br />
The reality is just a silhouette for me</p>
<p>My call for you will be a cry of love<br />
That&#8217;s why the wind sings the song of desire<br />
My call for you will be like a sunbeam<br />
That makes our love bloom again</p>
<p>Oh, my call for you will be a cry of love<br />
That&#8217;s why the wind sings the song of desire<br />
My call for you will be like a sunbeam<br />
That makes our love bloom again</p>
<p>That makes our love bloom again<br />
