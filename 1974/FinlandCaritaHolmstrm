<p>Oh my friend, stay a little while<br />
Something&#8217;s happening to our lives<br />
By the time it&#8217;s summer<br />
Frightened minds are winter</p>
<p>I will free from their icy spell<br />
Bring you fragrance from nature&#8217;s well<br />
I&#8217;ll soothe away your worries<br />
Show you how my love is<br />
Say you&#8217;ll stay and keep me warm</p>
<p>I need you &#8211; it&#8217;s simple to say<br />
I need you, I must be certain<br />
If you go away, you know there&#8217;s nothing for me</p>
<p>Oh my friend, stay and sit with me<br />
The nights ahead could be warm and free<br />
The morning winds I give you<br />
I won&#8217;t disappoint you<br />
Say you&#8217;ll stay and keep me warm</p>
<p>I need you &#8211; it&#8217;s simple to say<br />
I need you, I must be certain<br />
If you go away, you know there&#8217;s nothing for me</p>
<p>Oh my friend, when the summer comes<br />
We&#8217;ll be younger, we&#8217;ll have our fun<br />
I&#8217;ll soothe away your worries<br />
Show you how my love is<br />
Say you&#8217;ll stay and keep me warm</p>
<p>Say you&#8217;ll stay and keep me warm<br />
Stay and keep me warm<br />
Stay and keep me warm</p>
