<p>Cross your heart, say: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die<br />
For a very simple reason, and here&#8217;s the reason why:<br />
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die</p>
<p>Sticks and stones wouldn&#8217;t break my bones<br />
Though it happened again and again<br />
But I came smilling through, don&#8217;t ask me how</p>
<p>Playing at games and calling me names<br />
Never worried me then<br />
But it&#8217;s a different game we&#8217;re playing now</p>
<p>Cross your heart, say: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die<br />
For a very simple reason, and here&#8217;s the reason why:<br />
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy to get up, believe me<br />
To get up again and again<br />
Each time they knocked me down, it hurt a lot</p>
<p>Love&#8217;s got to show now, there&#8217;s nowhere to go now<br />
This is the end of the line<br />
Because I&#8217;m giving this all I&#8217;ve got</p>
<p>Cross your heart, say: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die<br />
For a very simple reason, and here&#8217;s the reason why:<br />
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die</p>
<p>Lalala la lalala&#8230; lalala la lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala la lalala&#8230; and here&#8217;s the reason why:<br />
For so many hearts are broken by one little lie<br />
Cross your heart and hope to die</p>
<p>La lala lala&#8230; la lala lala&#8230; la lala lala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala la lala lala&#8230; la lala lala&#8230; la lala lala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala la lala lala&#8230; la lala lala&#8230; la lala lala la&#8230;</p>
