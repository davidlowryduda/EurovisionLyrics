<p>The days and nights went by, but no one told me<br />
They can be fun too, if you only see<br />
There&#8217;s such a lot of beauty you can live for<br />
You only need someone to open up your eyes<br />
And you will see things never seen before</p>
<p>I see a star, a brand new star<br />
It&#8217;s right there, twinklin&#8217; in your eyes<br />
I see a face, a happy face<br />
It&#8217;s like the mirror of my mind</p>
<p>I see a star, a brand new star<br />
It&#8217;s right there, twinklin&#8217; in your eyes<br />
I see a face, a happy face<br />
It&#8217;s like the mirror of my mind</p>
<p>You opened up my eyes for all the beauty<br />
The beauty we&#8217;re inhaling every day<br />
It&#8217;s been there all my life, so it&#8217;s my duty<br />
I won&#8217;t lose sight of it, the fire that you lit<br />
Will keep on burning till the end of time</p>
<p>I see a star, a brand new star<br />
It&#8217;s right there, twinklin&#8217; in your eyes<br />
I see a face, a happy face<br />
It&#8217;s like the mirror of my mind</p>
<p>I see a star, a brand new star<br />
It&#8217;s right there, twinklin&#8217; in your eyes</p>
<p>Happiness now is being shared by two<br />
I just started my life anew</p>
<p>I see a star, a brand new star<br />
It&#8217;s right there, twinklin&#8217; in your eyes<br />
I see a face, a happy face<br />
It&#8217;s like the mirror of my mind</p>
