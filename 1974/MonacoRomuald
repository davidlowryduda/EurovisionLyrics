At the end of a love affair, the one who stays is the loser<br />
The one who leaves already knows somebody is waiting<br />
At the end of a love affair, at the moment of the last glance<br />
There&#8217;s always, always on earth somewhere</p>
<p>The one who stays and the one who leaves<br />
The one who talks and the one who doesn&#8217;t dare<br />
The one who cries, the one who lowers his eyes<br />
There&#8217;s always, always a moment of farewell</p>
<p>The one who stays and the one who leaves<br />
The one who cheats and the one who doesn&#8217;t know it<br />
The one who very soon is to be forgotten<br />
And the other who will stay alone all his life<br />
All his life</p>
<p>Of course I understand you, things had to happen this way<br />
You have the power to leave, I don&#8217;t have it<br />
Of course I understand, of course I&#8217;m not mad at you<br />
But lo and behold, &#8216;we&#8217; already became &#8216;you and me&#8217;</p>
<p>The one who stays and the one who leaves<br />
The one who talks and the one who doesn&#8217;t dare<br />
The one who cries, the one who lowers his eyes<br />
There&#8217;s always, always a moment of farewell</p>
<p>The one who stays and the one who leaves<br />
The one who cheats and the one who doesn&#8217;t know it<br />
The one who very soon is to be forgotten<br />
And the other who will stay alone all his life</p>
<p>The one who stays and the one who leaves<br />
