Suddenly that deadly night of year forty-two<br />
Seemed like it was going to snow<br />
But war arrived and a foreign soldier and fear</p>
<p>My mother gave me life to dream of freedom<br />
The first night to hear gun sounds<br />
To cry with my hand on my lips</p>
<p>My generation from year forty-two<br />
Nicely managed those intense days<br />
My generations from year forty-two<br />
Slept and longed for milk at that time</p>
<p>Times are different now and everyone has his own path<br />
The further we are, the more I want<br />
To know where they live, drink, sing, are now</p>
<p>My generation from year forty-two<br />
Is married now and has kids<br />
My generation from year forty-two<br />
Got all serious, because it has to be like that<br />
