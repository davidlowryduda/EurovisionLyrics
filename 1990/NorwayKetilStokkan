An entire world was present<br />
To share what happened this autumn<br />
We saw people weeping from happiness<br />
And a border opening towards the east</p>
<p>No one could avoid it, everyone was there<br />
And got to see (got to see) the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday<br />
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
We see the Brandenburg Gate<br />
Yes, we see the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>An entire people wished to live<br />
And tell about their rich culture<br />
We saw the truth out in the open on TV<br />
From a part of town hidden behind a wall</p>
<p>The city lifted its veil, everything looks like it used to<br />
To us (to us), at the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday<br />
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
We see the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>After many long years<br />
A new spring (new spring) for the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday<br />
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
We see the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>(Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate)<br />
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday<br />
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
We see the Brandenburg Gate</p>
<p>(Here we stand at the Brandenburg Gate)<br />
Hand in hand as if it were yesterday<br />
You and I at the Brandenburg Gate<br />
We see the Brandenburg Gate<br />
Yes, we see the Brandenburg Gate<br />
