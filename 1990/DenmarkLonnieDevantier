I look at my watch, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re home by now<br />
So I run down the stairs to call you<br />
But in the phone box a guy is standing with coins in his hand<br />
He takes more out of his pocket, as he scowls at me</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s free, I dial the number and get the connection<br />
But it&#8217;s only your answering machine that answers</p>
<p>I say: Hello, hello, I know you&#8217;re home<br />
Couldn&#8217;t you answer your phone?<br />
Hello, hello, I listen to your voice<br />
But when the tape runs out, nobody&#8217;s ever there</p>
<p>The bells of the town hall are ringing and here I stand freezing<br />
I&#8217;m tired of smart guys who just want to impress<br />
I&#8217;ve got a cold, I blow my nose, walk around sneezing<br />
And can hardly control my temper anymore</p>
<p>I take the receiver, but I&#8217;m still being made a fool of<br />
For it&#8217;s your stupid machine that answers</p>
<p>I say: Hello, hello, I know you&#8217;re home<br />
Couldn&#8217;t you answer your phone?<br />
Hello, hello, I listen to your voice<br />
But when the tape runs out, nobody&#8217;s ever there</p>
<p>I feed the phone with the last coin I&#8217;ve got<br />
Your machine remains the only to answer</p>
<p>I say: Hello, hello, I know you&#8217;re home<br />
Couldn&#8217;t you answer your phone?<br />
Hello, hello, I listen to your voice<br />
But when the tape runs out, nobody&#8217;s ever there</p>
<p>I say: Hello, hello, I knew you were home<br />
It was nice that you could answer your phone<br />
Hello, hello, I listen to your voice<br />
Even if the tape runs out, there&#8217;s still someone there<br />
It was nice that you could answer your phone<br />
