Out from a dream and into my heart<br />
Came a feeling and filled my soul<br />
And I&#8217;m a man who travels in thoughts<br />
Filled with visions from a dream<br />
And I feel&#8230;</p>
<p>Like a wind sweeping inside of me<br />
Making me warm, come, be closer to me<br />
Like a wind, show me the way<br />
Touch me like a wind</p>
<p>Together, but far apart<br />
We know that we want and we can<br />
A thought says more than thousand words<br />
Still I don&#8217;t know what to believe<br />
But I feel&#8230;</p>
<p>Like a wind sweeping inside of me<br />
Making me warm, come, be closer to me<br />
Like a wind, show me the way<br />
Touch me like a wind</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a man filled with visions<br />
Stay and touch me</p>
<p>Like a wind sweeping inside of me<br />
Making me warm, come, be closer to me<br />
Like a wind, show me the way<br />
Come to me, stay, don&#8217;t turn away<br />
Touch me like a wind</p>
<p>Touch me like a wind<br />
