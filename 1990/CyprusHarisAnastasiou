I don&#8217;t know how to love you<br />
I don&#8217;t know how to say it to you<br />
I don&#8217;t know what present to give you<br />
Which street I should walk along</p>
<p>Where will my history with you lead me<br />
While I follow you?</p>
<p>You talk too much, you ask for too much<br />
For once find a way<br />
To stop your talking<br />
You talk too much, you ask for too much</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I should remind you of<br />
Which melody, which rhythm<br />
With music I should make alive<br />
The words I say</p>
<p>Where will my history with you lead me<br />
While I follow you?</p>
<p>You talk too much, you ask for too much<br />
For once find a way<br />
To stop your talking<br />
You talk too much, you ask for too much</p>
<p>So we&#8217;d better end it an hour sooner<br />
Let&#8217;s finish once and for all<br />
It wasn&#8217;t right to continue<br />
We made lots of mistakes</p>
<p>You talk too much, you ask for too much<br />
For once find a way<br />
To stop your talking<br />
You talk too much, you ask for too much</p>
<p>You talk too much, you ask for too much<br />
For once find a way<br />
To stop your talking<br />
You talk too much, you ask for too much<br />
