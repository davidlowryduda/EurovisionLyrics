I see you right at the top of the towers<br />
In the buildings of Singapore<br />
Under a bit of rain in Cherbourg<br />
In the gardens of Luxembourg<br />
Always far away</p>
<p>A flight of birds over Manhattan<br />
Come back to tell me that you&#8217;re going away<br />
I draw our love as your absences pass by<br />
And it is like a summer that is beginning</p>
<p>When I dream of you, there are no more hours, no more distance<br />
Nothing is important anymore, I forget all my states of urgency<br />
When I dream of you, you take me, you lift me up<br />
A smile on your lips and I&#8217;m afraid of the day which is dawning<br />
When I dream of you, when I dream of you</p>
<p>You wait for me on the bench of a square<br />
In all the rooms of the air terminals<br />
I see you at the back of all the looks<br />
Behind the blue glass of the mirrors</p>
<p>I guess your face in all the transparency<br />
The journeys which I make in silence</p>
<p>When I dream of you, there are no more hours, no more distance<br />
Nothing is important anymore, I forget all my states of urgency<br />
When I dream of you, it&#8217;s like a wind which takes me away<br />
Which gives me a fever, come before the night comes to an end</p>
<p>Come into my dream, come into my dream<br />
Come into my dream, come into my dream<br />
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream<br />
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream<br />
Come into my dream</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; come into my dream<br />
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream<br />
Come into my dream, into my dream, into my dream<br />
