When someone talks to me about skin colour<br />
I have the blues which sends shivers down my spine<br />
I feel as if I&#8217;m in a tale by Edgar Allan Poe<br />
It&#8217;s the never more, the blue funk</p>
<p><em>White and black</em><br />
Dance, swing on the white and black blues<br />
We, the blacks<br />
We&#8217;re a few millions, a dime a dozen</p>
<p>Paradisiacal<br />
Africa, my love, I have you in my skin<br />
<em>White and black</em><br />
What does colour matter? All equal</p>
<p>Do you hear the beats of the tom-toms?<br />
They go right through your heart, pierce your soul<br />
Like the arrow of a hunter, equator<br />
A knife blade on which tears are sparkling</p>
<p><em>White and black</em><br />
Dance, swing on the white and black blues<br />
We, the blacks<br />
We&#8217;re a few millions, a dime a dozen</p>
<p>Along the river<br />
Under the sun overshadowed by the swamps<br />
Where it rains<br />
On our loves, may the storm come</p>
<p><em>White and black</em><br />
Dance, swing on the white and black blues<br />
We, the blacks<br />
We&#8217;re a few millions, a dime a dozen</p>
<p><em>Oh, white and black</em><br />
Dance, swing on the white and black blues<br />
<em>That&#8217;s all right</em><br />
Dance, swing on the white blues</p>
<p><em>And black</em><br />
