It was alone, and nobody wanted it<br />
I looked at it and felt in love with it<br />
It became mine, it was beautiful like never before<br />
The violin played for me this melody</p>
<p>Music sounds around the world<br />
Music, that my violin plays<br />
Music is heard in every house<br />
Music that everybody feels</p>
<p>Music sounds around the world<br />
Music, that my violin plays<br />
Music makes fairy tales come true<br />
Music, so wonderful</p>
<p>It plays in major, when the muse is kissing it<br />
And in minor, when the violin cries<br />
I stand by its side, I don&#8217;t want to lose it<br />
Want to stand by its side, it is like a part of me</p>
<p>Music sounds around the world<br />
Music, that my violin plays<br />
Music is heard in every house<br />
Music that everybody feels</p>
<p>Music sounds around the world<br />
Music, that my violin plays<br />
Music makes fairy tales come true<br />
Music, so wonderful</p>
<p>Music sounds around the world<br />
Music, that my violin plays<br />
Music is heard in every house<br />
Music that everybody feels</p>
<p>Music sounds around the world<br />
Music, that my violin plays<br />
Music makes fairy tales come true<br />
Music, so wonderful<br />
