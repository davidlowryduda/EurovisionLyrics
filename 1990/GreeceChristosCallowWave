<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Every night I dance<br />
I wander in the shadows and darkness<br />
I am looking for you in the stars<br />
And in the street music</p>
<p>If I could only steal your dream<br />
And dive into your fever<br />
When you say I love you<br />
And when you go away without a purpose</p>
<p>Too many roads hurt<br />
Too many doors without people and light<br />
You must be somewhere<br />
Forgotten even by yourself</p>
<p>If I could only steal your dream<br />
And dive into your fever<br />
When you say I love you<br />
And when you go away without a purpose</p>
<p>If you can dream<br />
The day that is coming in silence<br />
Then you will be strong enough<br />
To face the sun<br />
But I know you will cry</p>
<p>And then I will steal your dream<br />
And I will dive into your fever<br />
When you say I love you<br />
And when you go away without a purpose<br />
