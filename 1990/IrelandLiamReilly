<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since we were together<br />
I&#8217;m back in Ireland and I miss you more than ever<br />
In early spring we parted and I&#8217;ve been here since then<br />
But if I could only see you once again</p>
<p>Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night<br />
We could be in Rome again, &#8216;neath the Trevi fountain light<br />
We should be together, and maybe we just might<br />
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight</p>
<p>I remember Amsterdam as we sailed along the canal<br />
And as the leaves began to fall, we were walking in old Bruxelles<br />
In the Black Forest on a German summer&#8217;s day<br />
And the memories refuse to go away</p>
<p>Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night<br />
We could be in Rome again, &#8216;neath the Trevi fountain light<br />
We should be together, and maybe we just might<br />
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you remember those Adriatic days?<br />
I miss your laughter and all your little ways<br />
I can still see you in London, walking on Trafalgar Square<br />
And drinking wine in Old Seville, how I wish that we were there</p>
<p>Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night<br />
We could be in Rome again, &#8216;neath the Trevi fountain light<br />
We should be together, maybe we just might<br />
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight</p>
<p>Meet me in Paris on a Champs-Élysées night<br />
We could be in Rome again, &#8216;neath the Trevi fountain light<br />
We should be together, and maybe we just might<br />
If you could only meet me somewhere in Europe tonight</p>
<p>Somewhere in Europe tonight<br />
Somewhere in Europe</p>
