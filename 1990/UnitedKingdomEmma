<p>We&#8217;ve come so far on this great planet<br />
We should be proud of all the great things we&#8217;ve achieved<br />
But in our search for life&#8217;s great knowledge<br />
We go on takin&#8217; out and never plant new seeds</p>
<p>Give a little love back to the world<br />
We can&#8217;t go on takin&#8217; out forever<br />
Give a little love back to the world<br />
We still got time, let&#8217;s do it together<br />
Give a little love back to the world</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to stop, think of tomorrow<br />
One day our children may have nothing left to share<br />
Let&#8217;s do it now, then in the future<br />
They will look back at us with pride and know we cared</p>
<p>Give a little love back to the world<br />
We can&#8217;t go on takin&#8217; out forever<br />
Give a little love back to the world<br />
We still got time, let&#8217;s do it together</p>
<p>We got no time to hesitate<br />
Tomorrow it may be too late</p>
<p>Give a little love back to the world<br />
We can&#8217;t go on takin&#8217; out forever<br />
Give a little love back to the world<br />
We still got time, let&#8217;s do it together</p>
<p>We still got time, we can do it together<br />
Give a little love back to the world<br />
(Give a little love back) To the world</p>
