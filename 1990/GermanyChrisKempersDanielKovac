Free to live, to trust the feeling<br />
Giving, taking – is it so difficult?<br />
Free to live and to look ahead<br />
Step by step, hand in hand, more and more</p>
<p>We are not lonely, but everyone is alone<br />
Let&#8217;s tear down the invisible walls<br />
Everyone is waiting for a miracle, and the miracle can happen<br />
We just have to go together across all frontiers</p>
<p>Free to live and looking forward to goals<br />
Isn&#8217;t it time for giving and taking?<br />
Free to live, fearing no questions<br />
Day by day, hand in hand, now and today</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let us look backwards, don&#8217;t ask me what will happen<br />
Take me as I am and let us be honest<br />
Don&#8217;t let us make plans which will weigh us down like chains<br />
Don&#8217;t trap your wishes inside yourself</p>
<p>Free to live to trust the feeling<br />
Giving, taking – is it so difficult?<br />
Free to live and to look ahead<br />
Step by step, hand in hand, more and more</p>
<p>(Free to live) To lose every fear<br />
(To trust the feeling) To try out every hope<br />
(Taking, giving &#8211; is it so difficult?)<br />
When you are beside me, it&#8217;s not difficult for me</p>
<p>Free to live and to look ahead<br />
Step by step, hand in hand, more and more<br />
Free to love, free to live, hand in hand<br />
Free, but not alone<br />
Let it become true today<br />
