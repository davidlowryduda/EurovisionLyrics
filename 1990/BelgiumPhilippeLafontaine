When she cries, it&#8217;s the whole Adriatic<br />
Which floods her eyes<br />
When she sleeps, it&#8217;s not far from Ohrid<br />
She dreams on the edge of beautiful blue lakes</p>
<p>I see her again, a little girl<br />
On bare feet with rain in her hair<br />
In her house, on the earthen floor<br />
She has left the illusions of all her games</p>
<p>Too many desire her<br />
She has the charm of Macedonian women<br />
It&#8217;s vital that I love her, that I hold her<br />
Whatever you may do or think<br />
But she is more beautiful</p>
<p>Those who don&#8217;t believe me let them come<br />
They will see how much I have and that she is mine<br />
You can shout, you can cry, you can laugh<br />
But certainly not at her</p>
<p>When she sleeps, it&#8217;s at the bottom of the hill<br />
That she does with my body what she wants to<br />
It&#8217;s a sunflower that is emigrated into the vines<br />
With a heart of stone, and making flames of a fire</p>
<p>A gipsy cry hidden in her murmurs<br />
She lives love without denial<br />
When she fights from the top of her wounds<br />
She pretends everything, she mocks the gods</p>
<p>Too many desire her<br />
She has the charm of Macedonian women<br />
It&#8217;s vital that I love her, that I hold her<br />
Whatever you may do or think<br />
But she is more beautiful</p>
<p>Those who don&#8217;t believe me let them come<br />
They will see how much I have and that she is mine<br />
You can shout, you can cry, you can laugh<br />
But certainly not at her<br />
