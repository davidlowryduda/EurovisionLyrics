<p>Early in the morning<br />
You were sleeping silently and softly<br />
I covered myself in the coat<br />
Not wanting to look</p>
<p>I left everything in its place<br />
And the keys<br />
In the box, as always</p>
<p>Look at me &#8211; singing in the streets<br />
Gathering loves<br />
Avoiding miracles and disappointments<br />
Singing in the streets</p>
<p>Because I wanted to give up<br />
To not be with you anymore<br />
I wasn&#8217;t thinking about what is or isn&#8217;t worthwhile<br />
And you, who are all my life<br />
Will remain like a salt inscription on my hands</p>
<p>This morning<br />
Has the taste of strange freedom<br />
Like of death or a blessing<br />
Because I went away from you</p>
<p>Look at me &#8211; singing in the streets<br />
Gathering loves<br />
Avoiding miracles and disappointments<br />
Singing in the streets</p>
<p>And the great waters that you had been for me<br />
Have gone far away and don&#8217;t come to me anymore<br />
And you, who are all my life<br />
Will remain a salt inscription on my hands</p>
<p>Oh, look at me<br />
Look at me and the great waters<br />
Have gone far away and don&#8217;t come to me anymore<br />
And you, who are all my life<br />
Will remain like a salt inscription on my hands</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; ooh&#8230;<br />
And I went away from you<br />
And I went away from you<br />
