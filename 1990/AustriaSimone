Around this time last year, nobody would have thought<br />
That our desire for freedom would take this leap forward<br />
The present time comes quickly, it must at any price<br />
Be more colourful, not just black and white</p>
<p>For our future is just born now<br />
Many languages, many ears</p>
<p>No walls anymore, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>no walls anywhere</em></font><br />
(No walls anymore)<br />
Let the barriers fall, no walls anymore<br />
No walls anymore</p>
<p>The wind is strong, it increases to gale, blows someone in the face<br />
The firm hand is broken by the resistance<br />
For our future is just born now<br />
Many languages, many ears</p>
<p>No walls anymore, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>no walls anywhere</em></font><br />
(No walls anymore)<br />
There are no more walls, no walls anymore</p>
<p>No walls anymore<br />
