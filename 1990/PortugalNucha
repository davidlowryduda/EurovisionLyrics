Ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
Who still doesn&#8217;t have as much as we do<br />
Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
In the corner of the world who also dreams</p>
<p>Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
Who still doesn&#8217;t have as much as we do<br />
Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
In the corner of the world who also dreams</p>
<p>Life was running in front of us<br />
No colours and harmony<br />
A step was a wall that silenced the voice<br />
And truth meant nothing</p>
<p>How many moments did we lose?<br />
Afraid of life, the dream was in vain, aha&#8230;</p>
<p>Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
Who still doesn&#8217;t have as much as we do<br />
Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
In the corner of the world who also dreams</p>
<p>The voices of the wind and the waves of the sea<br />
Brought this new day<br />
Now we came without having to dream<br />
Moments of mad joy</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s sing together without looking backwards<br />
Nothing can stop love and peace</p>
<p>Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
Who still doesn&#8217;t have as much as we do<br />
Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
In the corner of the world who also dreams</p>
<p>Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
Who still doesn&#8217;t have as much as we do<br />
Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
In the corner of the world who also dreams</p>
<p>Always, there&#8217;s always someone<br />
