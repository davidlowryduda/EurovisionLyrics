<p>The moon bewitched me and took me to you<br />
Love poison that I drank happily<br />
And although my chest burned and scorched my skin<br />
For me, it tasted as sweet as honey</p>
<p>Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies<br />
The blood and the life of my heart<br />
Your absence in my nights causes sadness<br />
Sighs and tears of dark passion</p>
<p>And now every time that you leave me<br />
I feel the pain growing bigger and bigger</p>
<p>Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies<br />
The blood and the life of my heart<br />
Your absence in my nights causes sadness<br />
Sighs and tears, and dark passion</p>
<p>So embrace me with hurricane fury<br />
May the fire of your love be like a volcano<br />
And then kiss me, trap me in your net<br />
May your lips finally quench my thirst</p>
<p>Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies<br />
The blood and the life of my heart<br />
Your absence in my nights causes sadness<br />
Sighs and tears, and dark passion</p>
<p>Your eyes, bandit, stole with lies<br />
The blood and the life of my heart<br />
Your absence in my nights causes sadness<br />
Sighs and tears, and dark passion<br />
