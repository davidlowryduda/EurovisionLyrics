With you I become as I should be<br />
Completely wild, I match your rhythm, you seduce me<br />
I go by what the eye sees<br />
When I want something I demand, I become dangerous</p>
<p>One more song, a real swing and here<br />
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end<br />
One more beat, tones to play with<br />
That which charms me and strikes my heart</p>
<p>With me there&#8217;s no question<br />
When we meet each other, I conjure a brew<br />
A lot of fun comes with you<br />
So I somehow turn wild, I turn crazy</p>
<p>One more song, a real swing and here<br />
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end<br />
One more beat, tones to play with<br />
That which charms me and strikes my heart</p>
<p>In your arms, I am free, we&#8217;ll go anywhere<br />
Let&#8217;s let the magic of life take all control</p>
<p>One more song, a real swing and here<br />
Nobody tires, you must dance until the end<br />
One more beat, the game is only about<br />
Us continuing faster, and never hesitating</p>
<p>That we continue, faster now<br />
Never hesitate, me and you, with anything<br />
