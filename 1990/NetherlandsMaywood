You are not the only one<br />
Who&#8217;s feeling lost<br />
And although my words sounded rougher<br />
Than I had meant them</p>
<p>I meant everything I said<br />
I also learned<br />
To fight for a new day<br />
Is that wrong then?</p>
<p>I want to share everything with you<br />
Want to be everything for you<br />
And if you want to trust me<br />
Then we&#8217;ll share the pain</p>
<p>Crying together<br />
Getting crazy together<br />
Losing our head together<br />
Nothing is too crazy for me</p>
<p>Life is a merry-go-round<br />
Life is a street<br />
That comes to a dead end once<br />
When you don&#8217;t know anymore where to go</p>
<p>A moment, yes just a moment<br />
You think: it&#8217;s over<br />
But I love you the way you are<br />
Do you love me too?</p>
<p>I want to share everything with you<br />
Want to be everything for you<br />
And if you want to trust me<br />
Then we&#8217;ll share the pain</p>
<p>Crying together<br />
Getting crazy together<br />
Losing our head together<br />
And nothing is too crazy for me</p>
<p>When I see the light on the horizon<br />
I still remember how it was<br />
How it once started</p>
<p>I want to share everything with you<br />
I want to be everything for you</p>
<p>Crying together<br />
Getting crazy together<br />
Losing our head together<br />
Nothing is too crazy for me<br />
