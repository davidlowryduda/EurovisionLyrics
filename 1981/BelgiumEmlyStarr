Talks a lot about conquests<br />
About disloyal love<br />
You know what to concoct<br />
For every beautiful woman</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; playboy, I&#8217;d rather forget you<br />
Ooh ooh&#8230; no one can give you love</p>
<p>Samson<br />
Hundreds of stories without a Delilah<br />
Samson<br />
Forget your wild hairs, find yourself a Delilah<br />
Samson</p>
<p>You care more about your strange friends<br />
With whom you build castles in the air<br />
With friends you want to find joy<br />
Though I really love you</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; playboy, I want to live with you<br />
Ooh ooh&#8230; no one can give you love</p>
<p>Samson<br />
Hundreds of stories without a Delilah<br />
Samson<br />
Forget your wild hairs, find yourself a Delilah<br />
Sharing your love is too much</p>
<p>I&#8217;m your Delilah (if you want to), I&#8217;m longing for you<br />
The true Delilah (if you want to), your only wife</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; playboy, I want to live with you<br />
Ooh ooh&#8230; no one else can give you love</p>
<p>Samson<br />
Hundreds of stories without a Delilah<br />
Samson<br />
I take your wild hairs gladly<br />
Gladly along with me</p>
<p>Samson, I love you<br />
Samson<br />
