<p>Before we say goodbye, before the day is done<br />
Many things will be said between us<br />
A thousand words, a thousand sounds until the night</p>
<p>It seems as if it had already happened, it seems as if it had already been<br />
It seems as if they had already been said between us<br />
All of the words, all of the sounds every night</p>
<p>What had been, what had been, been between us<br />
What had happened, what had happened that we both had said<br />
All the words, all the sounds every night<br />
That we both had said</p>
<p>What had been, what had been, been between us<br />
What had happened, what had happened that we both had said<br />
All the words, all the sounds every night</p>
<p>Every night, la<br />
Every night, la</p>
<p>Tonight, tonight, it will be the night<br />
We&#8217;ll say things we&#8217;ve never said before</p>
<p>Tonight, tonight, it will be the night<br />
(Every night, day and night)<br />
In which we&#8217;ll say without words, without sounds<br />
We&#8217;ll say things of love</p>
<p>What had been, what had been, been between us<br />
What had happened, what had happened that we both had said<br />
All the words, all the sounds every night<br />
Every night, night</p>
<p>(What had been, what had been, been between us)<br />
(What had been, what had been that we both had said)<br />
All the words, all the sounds every night</p>
<p>Every night, la<br />
Every night, la<br />
Every night, la<br />
Every night, la<br />
