In my house it happens that the night is long<br />
In my house you can feel something is going on<br />
And when the day turns to dusk, restlessness invites you to dance<br />
You&#8217;re trying to escape but can&#8217;t go anywhere 	 </p>
<p>And captured in a dream that doesn&#8217;t set you free<br />
Captured in a dream, you&#8217;re held back by your fantasy<br />
Yes, captured once more and if only you could escape<br />
Still captured in a dream, you remain until the day is dawning<br />
In a dream, in a dream</p>
<p>In a time when the world is supposed to be logical<br />
In a time when fairy tales don&#8217;t fit in<br />
You see reality fall apart with chills in your skin<br />
And though you&#8217;re screaming out your fear, no sounds are heard</p>
<p>And captured in a dream that doesn&#8217;t set you free<br />
Captured in a dream, you&#8217;re held back by your fantasy<br />
Yes, captured once more and if only you could escape<br />
Still captured in a dream, you remain until the day is dawning</p>
<p>Captured in a dream that doesn&#8217;t set you free<br />
Captured in a dream, you&#8217;re held back by your fantasy<br />
In a dream, in a dream, in a dream, in a dream<br />
