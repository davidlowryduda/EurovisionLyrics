It may not be America<br />
But America isn&#8217;t everything<br />
I&#8217;ve got music in my heart<br />
And this music means a lot to me</p>
<p>It comes from the north of the Provence<br />
As Tramontane or Mistral<br />
It&#8217;s the fiddle to dance to<br />
Or the choral in the cathedral</p>
<p>It sings during my evening parties<br />
And rocks my nights when I feel a bit down<br />
It&#8217;s a ballad or a ditty<br />
It&#8217;s piano, it&#8217;s guitar</p>
<p>It may not be America<br />
But America isn&#8217;t everything<br />
I&#8217;ve got music in my heart<br />
And this music means a lot to me</p>
<p>It comes from the depths of my memories<br />
Even before we were born<br />
It tells us our story<br />
Our roots and our past</p>
<p>If the universe is stormy<br />
If the earth is shaking underneath our feet<br />
We&#8217;ll go on with our journey<br />
So that it will never stop singing</p>
<p>It may not be America<br />
But America isn&#8217;t everything<br />
I&#8217;ve got music in my heart<br />
And this music means a lot to me</p>
<p>(It may not be America)<br />
(But America isn&#8217;t everything)<br />
I&#8217;ve got music in my heart<br />
And this music means a lot to me<br />
