After the storm, we walk a bit<br />
On the wet sand, we talk a bit<br />
I was wrong, you were wrong<br />
What has been has been, we must not speak about it anymore</p>
<p>Me without you, what shall I do?<br />
I don&#8217;t breathe if you are not here<br />
Me without you, what shall I be?<br />
A butterfly that doesn&#8217;t fly anymore</p>
<p>Bring you on the wind like a year ago<br />
The same sentiment, the same intensity<br />
And find words that are never said<br />
While the sun dies in my heart, you&#8217;ll stay</p>
<p>Me without you, what shall I do<br />
With my life and my days?<br />
Me without you, how shall I do it?<br />
My love, I must invent you</p>
<p>Me without you, what shall I do?<br />
Me without you, how shall I do it?<br />
My love, I must invent you</p>
<p>My love, I must invent you<br />
