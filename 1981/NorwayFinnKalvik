(Never in my life, never in my life)</p>
<p>The dawn is humming a soft, carefree song<br />
Like when I saw you for the first time<br />
In your timeless eyes there are answers<br />
That no one else that I know has</p>
<p>Every time I go away, do you think of me then?<br />
Every time I go away, do not forget the promise I made:</p>
<p>Never in my life have I thought of leaving you<br />
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind<br />
Never in my life have I thought of leaving you<br />
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind</p>
<p>You have given life a new harmony<br />
The time in loneliness is gone<br />
I have been blinded, but now I can see<br />
Darling, because you have taught me how</p>
<p>Every time I go away, do you think of me then?<br />
Every time I go away, do not forget the promise I made:</p>
<p>Never in my life have I thought of leaving you<br />
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind<br />
Never in my life have I thought of leaving you<br />
Never in my life, my friend, before I join the wind</p>
<p>(Never in my life, never in my life)<br />
(Never in my life, never in my life)<br />
