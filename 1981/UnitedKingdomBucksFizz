<p>You gotta speed it up and then you gotta slow it down<br />
&#8216;Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top you gotta play around<br />
But soon you will find that there comes a time<br />
For making your mind up</p>
<p>You gotta turn it on and then you gotta put it out<br />
You gotta be sure that it&#8217;s something everybody&#8217;s gonna talk about<br />
Before you decide that the time&#8217;s arrived<br />
For making your mind up</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your indecision<br />
Take you from behind<br />
Trust your inner vision<br />
Don&#8217;t let others change your mind</p>
<p>And now you really gotta burn it up and make another fly by night<br />
Get a run for your money and take a chance and it&#8217;ll turn out right<br />
But when you can see how it&#8217;s gotta be<br />
You&#8217;re making your mind up</p>
<p>And try to look as if you don&#8217;t care less, but if you wanna see some more<br />
Bending the rules of the game will let you find the one you&#8217;re looking for<br />
And then you can show that you think you know<br />
You&#8217;re making your mind up</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your indecision<br />
Take you from behind<br />
Trust your inner vision<br />
Don&#8217;t let others change your mind</p>
<p>And now you really gotta speed it up<br />
And then you gotta slow it down<br />
&#8216;Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top</p>
<p>You gotta play around<br />
But soon you will find that there comes a time<br />
For making your mind up</p>
<p>And now you really gotta speed it up<br />
And then you gotta slow it down<br />
&#8216;Cause if you believe that our love can hit the top</p>
<p>You gotta play around<br />
But soon you will find that there comes a time<br />
For making your mind up</p>
<p>For making your mind up<br />
For making your mind up<br />
For making your mind up</p>
