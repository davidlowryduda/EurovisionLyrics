<p>Rushing for the papers every day<br />
To find out what the stars have got to say<br />
About the fortunes that are on the way<br />
It&#8217;s crazy, crazy</p>
<p>Working, not waiting that forever will hold<br />
Success comes from what we do, not from what we&#8217;re told<br />
And counting on lucky stars is living on false hopes</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the planets take control of our lives<br />
Believe in the truth and not celestial lies<br />
It&#8217;s we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes</p>
<p>Virgos and Arians, Leos, Aquarians, Pisces, Cancerians show<br />
No matter when we&#8217;re born, Libra or Capricorn<br />
Taureans and Scorpions know</p>
<p>Nothing can change the way we&#8217;ve chosen to live<br />
And no one can tell us when to take or to give<br />
It&#8217;s we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of this, when daylight dies<br />
There we are, with eyes turned to the sky<br />
All anxious to be told a few more lies<br />
Still crazy, crazy</p>
<p>Working, not waiting that forever will hold<br />
Success comes from what we do, not from what we&#8217;re told<br />
And counting on lucky stars is living on false hopes</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the planets take control of our lives<br />
Believe in the truth and not celestial lies<br />
It&#8217;s we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes</p>
<p>Throw away almanacs, signs of the Zodiac, then there is sense to be found<br />
They are celestial, we are terrestrial, let&#8217;s keep our feet on the ground</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let the planets take control of our lives<br />
Believe in the truth and not celestial lies<br />
It&#8217;s we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes<br />
It&#8217;s we, not the stars above, who write our horoscopes</p>
