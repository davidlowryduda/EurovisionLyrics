When you are gone and though all the birds are singing<br />
When you are gone and though the flowers are blooming<br />
I&#8217;m lonely and all the people around me are behaving<br />
As if nothing had happened</p>
<p>When you are gone I don&#8217;t hear the birds&#8217; song<br />
When you are gone and though the flowers are blooming<br />
I&#8217;m lonely and all the people around me are behaving<br />
Then I miss you so much</p>
<p>When you are gone I don&#8217;t hear the birds&#8217; song<br />
When you are gone the sun itself shines dimly<br />
Whatever I do, everything is bland and lost<br />
Then I miss you so much</p>
<p>But when you are here and I breathe close to you<br />
When you are close to me and I look in the eyes<br />
When you are here and I take you in my arms<br />
We are forgetting the world around us</p>
<p>When you are here I see the tree blooming again<br />
When you are here I see the flowers blooming again<br />
When you are here I wish so much<br />
Please never don&#8217;t go again</p>
<p>When you are gone I walk around without any aim<br />
Totally lost, I feel hollowed and empty<br />
When you are gone I have no more plans<br />
Then I miss you so much</p>
<p>But when you are here and I breathe close to you<br />
When you are close to me and I look in the eyes<br />
When you are here and I take you in my arms<br />
We are forgetting the world around us</p>
<p>When you are here I see the tree blooming again<br />
When you are here I see the flowers blooming again<br />
When you are here I wish so much<br />
Please never don&#8217;t go again<br />
