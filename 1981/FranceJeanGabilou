On a galaxy in the year three thousand (In the year three thousand)<br />
An old man is sitting on the grey ground (On the grey ground)<br />
Around him, all the children are gathered<br />
To listen to what he&#8217;s going to say</p>
<p>Look, my children, over there, in the night (There, in the night)<br />
This shining ball was full of life (Full of life)<br />
The men of not long ago were proud of it<br />
And baptized it: the Earth</p>
<p>Humanahum (Humana-huma)<br />
Humanahum (Humana-huma)<br />
Humanahum<br />
Land, Land of Men</p>
<p>There were water and tall trees (What is a tree?)<br />
And thousands of birds flying over the waves (What is a wave?)<br />
And a lot of fruits in the valleys and the prairies<br />
And forests could still sing</p>
<p>There were women and girls in flowers (What is a flower?)<br />
The men had them around their hearts (What is a heart?)<br />
The women of not long ago were proud of it<br />
Love was fruit of the earth</p>
<p>Humanahum (Humana-huma)<br />
Humanahum (Humana-huma)<br />
Humanahum<br />
Land, Land of Men</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s that, my friends, the story is finished (Why finished?)<br />
This shining ball has no more life (Has no more life)<br />
The men of not long ago were all brothers<br />
But they invented the war</p>

Humanahum (Humana-huma)<br />
Humanahum<br />
Land, Land of Men</p>

Land, Land of Men</p>
