Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
Everybody is singing your songs<br />
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
And the whole world is listening</p>
<p>He grew up without any friends because no one wanted to play<br />
With someone who was blind, like him<br />
And he mostly sat at home, the boys outside<br />
They just shouted after him</p>
<p>They shouted:<br />
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
What colour is the sun?<br />
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
Children can be cruel</p>
<p>On the old guitar that somebody gave him<br />
He played, it was his friend<br />
His songs, they sounded of hope and joy<br />
And sometimes as if someone was crying</p>
<p>And he sang: Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
What colour is the sun?<br />
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
And all the children were listening</p>
<p>And soon nobody could play like him (Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)<br />
His songs touched people&#8217;s hearts (What colour is the sun?)<br />
And he painted colours with his music (Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)<br />
And forgot all his pain</p>
<p>And soon tenthousands came to his concerts<br />
Because he gave them the power<br />
To believe in the future, in the darkness of life<br />
He had made it himself</p>
<p>Oh Johnny Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
And they all kept coming back<br />
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
Nobody plays as beautifully as you</p>
<p>Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
Everybody is singing your songs<br />
Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue<br />
And the whole world is listening</p>
<p>(Blue, Blue, Blue, Johnny Blue)<br />
And the whole world is listening<br />
