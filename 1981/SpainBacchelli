And only you, and only I<br />
In love on the beach under the sun<br />
There&#8217;s no one else around<br />
And I draw a heart in the sand</p>
<p>The wind tangles your hair<br />
As if it wants to caress you</p>
<p>And only you, and only I<br />
The blue sky and love in your eyes<br />
Looking at the bewitching sea<br />
We embrace each other with the strength of a cyclone</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa&#8230;<br />
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>And only you, and only I<br />
We know all the secrets of love<br />
And only you, and only I<br />
In our sweet world, happy and dreamy world</p>
<p>In my arms I kiss you<br />
I feel a burning fire on your lips</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa&#8230;<br />
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>And only you, and only I<br />
We know all the secrets of love<br />
And only you, and only I<br />
In our sweet world, happy and dreamy world</p>
<p>In my arms I kiss you<br />
I feel a burning fire on your lips</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa&#8230;<br />
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
I&#8217;m staying with my loneliness in a corner, whoa&#8230;<br />
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is the same if you&#8217;re not here<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa&#8230;<br />
