Maybe you don&#8217;t know how to sing or even how to whistle<br />
But you won&#8217;t sing out of tune for sure<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback</p>
<p>You just have to get it right, there&#8217;s nothing to it<br />
And even without singing, you&#8217;re going to enchant<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback</p>
<p>Put the microphone in front of you, it&#8217;s very disguisingly<br />
Smile, so the people won&#8217;t notice it</p>
<p>In playback, you&#8217;re someone<br />
Even aphonic, you sing in tune<br />
In playback, miming, long live playback<br />
You&#8217;ll always sing</p>
<p>In playback why bother to breathe?<br />
Those who don&#8217;t know it, won&#8217;t see it<br />
In playback, miming, long live playback<br />
It&#8217;s for a whole evening</p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t know how to sing or even how to whistle<br />
But you won&#8217;t sing out of tune for sure<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback</p>
<p>You just have to get it right, there&#8217;s nothing to it<br />
And even without singing, you&#8217;re going to enchant<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback</p>
<p>Open your mouth, close your mouth<br />
Don&#8217;t make mistakes, don&#8217;t stop breathing<br />
You&#8217;re going to be worshipped, perform to delight</p>
<p>In playback, you sing in tune<br />
Singing without missing the notes<br />
In playback, miming, long live playback<br />
You&#8217;ll always sing</p>
<p>With playback, they even ask for an encore<br />
&#8220;But of course&#8221;, you&#8217;ll say happily<br />
In playback, miming, long live playback<br />
You thank and smile</p>
<p>Maybe you don&#8217;t know how to sing or even how to whistle<br />
But you won&#8217;t sing out of tune for sure<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback</p>
<p>You just have to get it right, there&#8217;s nothing to it<br />
And even without singing, you&#8217;re going to enchant<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback</p>
<p>In playback, in playback, in playback<br />
In playback, in playback, in playback<br />
