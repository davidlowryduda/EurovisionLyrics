I have a two year old son with big, blond curls<br />
I have a three year old boy with big, brown eyes<br />
But I&#8217;ve got one more than you<br />
OK, perhaps, but none is better than mine<br />
For he&#8217;s very special if I do say so myself</p>
<p>Curly hair or not, we love our children<br />
Brown eyes or not, you love your children</p>
<p>For one thing is certain<br />
We all hope that they&#8217;ll get the things they want<br />
Whether they&#8217;re four or sixty, have curly hair or not</p>
<p>For one thing is certain<br />
We all hope that they&#8217;ll get the things they want<br />
Whether they&#8217;re four or sixty, have curly hair or not</p>
<p>Long live all children<br />
