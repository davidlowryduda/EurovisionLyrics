Years pass by, love and snow<br />
Find us always together<br />
We weathered storms and hard times<br />
But always our love remains</p>
<p>I never remember me being worried<br />
Because it was always you<br />
My trusted company, my happy song<br />
My golden love and hope</p>
<p>Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni<br />
Moni, Moni, Monica<br />
You live for me, I live for you<br />
And everything is in harmony</p>
<p>Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni<br />
Moni, Moni, Monica<br />
You live for me, I live for you<br />
And everything is in harmony</p>
<p>I never remember me being worried because<br />
It was always you<br />
My trusted company, my happy song<br />
My golden love and hope</p>
<p>Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni<br />
Moni, Moni, Monica<br />
You live for me, I live for you<br />
And everything is in harmony</p>
<p>Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni<br />
Moni, Moni, Monica<br />
You live for me, I live for you<br />
And everything is in harmony</p>
<p>Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni<br />
Moni, Moni, Monica<br />
You live for me, I live for you<br />
And everything is in harmony</p>
<p>Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni, Moni<br />
Moni, Moni, Monica<br />
You live for me, I live for you<br />
And everything is in harmony</p>
<p>Monica<br />
