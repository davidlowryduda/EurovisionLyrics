<p>Once upon a time there was this guy called Johnny<br />
He was kinda shy and so in love with Connie<br />
But so was O&#8217;Smarty, who played it cool<br />
The king of the party, but oh what a fool (What a fool)</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know how to twist<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to make a girl insist<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to move, he didn&#8217;t feel the groove<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to twist</p>
<p>(Twist, he didn&#8217;t know how to twist)<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to move, he didn&#8217;t feel the groove<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to twist</p>
<p>Once upon a night there was this guy called Johnny<br />
He was kinda high and dancing with his honey<br />
The queen of the party proclaimed him king<br />
While poor old O&#8217;Smarty was left in the ring</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know how to twist<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to make a girl insist<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to move, he didn&#8217;t feel the groove<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to twist</p>
<p>(Twist, he didn&#8217;t know how to twist)<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to move, he didn&#8217;t feel the groove<br />
He didn&#8217;t know how to twist<br />
Hit it, Johnny</p>
<p>A twist of love, a twist of pain<br />
A twist of me and you<br />
A twist of things you can&#8217;t explain<br />
Will make your dream come true</p>
<p>Be sure you know how to twist<br />
Be sure you know how to make a girl insist<br />
Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove<br />
Be sure you know how to twist</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; (Twist)<br />
Yeah, twist<br />
Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove<br />
Be sure you know how to twist</p>
<p>Be sure you know how to move, be sure you feel the groove<br />
Be sure you know how to twist</p>
