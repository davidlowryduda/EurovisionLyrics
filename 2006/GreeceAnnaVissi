<p>I can hear my heart breaking as I open the door<br />
I can feel the tears on my face burn like fire<br />
As I look in your eyes<br />
And I know I&#8217;m still in love</p>
<p>With everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you<br />
Baby, baby, I&#8217;m still in love</p>
<p>With everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you<br />
Everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you</p>
<p>I can feel my life ending as I whisper goodbye<br />
And I know I&#8217;m still in love</p>
<p>With everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you<br />
With everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I still need you<br />
I can&#8217;t believe I still want you<br />
I can&#8217;t believe life means nothing without you<br />
Baby, I&#8217;m still in love, still in love, still in love</p>
<p>With everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you<br />
Everything I hate, everything you do<br />
Everything I fear, everything on you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with everything you are</p>
