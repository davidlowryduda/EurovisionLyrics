I&#8217;m lost trying to forget, do not burden my days<br />
Everything is in vain, I don&#8217;t understand<br />
I tire of forgetting, with time I kill my memories<br />
In fire we&#8217;re so cold</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to go, I&#8217;m killing myself, I see you and you blind me<br />
We&#8217;re in fire, and we search for cold<br />
And in passion we are stopping ourselves<br />
I&#8217;m frightened of my heart which loves you so</p>
<p>And I feel fire and cold, I can&#8217;t do it any more<br />
My hope is lost in you<br />
Darling, help me<br />
I go away because I love you</p>
<p>Fire and cold, I tire in vain<br />
I&#8217;m always there in your lips<br />
I&#8217;m lost there, because my soul feels you</p>
<p>(Open, open, open, open your heart)<br />
(Open, open, darling)<br />
(Open, open, open, open, darling)<br />
(Open, open, open, open, darling)</p>
<p>Everything in vain<br />
My heart looks for a station, and in you it stops</p>
<p>Because all the thoughts, dreams, live only in you<br />
I want to kiss you but I can&#8217;t<br />
Without you, my life I can&#8217;t understand<br />
I&#8217;m frightened of my heart which loves you so</p>
<p>And I feel fire and cold, I can&#8217;t do it any more<br />
My hope is lost in you<br />
Darling, help me<br />
I go away because I love you</p>
<p>Fire and cold, I tire in vain<br />
I&#8217;m always there in your lips<br />
I&#8217;m lost there, because my soul feels you</p>
<p>And I feel fire and cold<br />
Darling<br />
Fire and cold (I tire in vain, darling)<br />
Hey&#8230; because my soul feels you</p>
<p>And I feel fire and cold, I can&#8217;t do it any more (Darling)<br />
My hope is lost in you<br />
Darling, help me<br />
I go away because I love you</p>
<p>Fire and cold, I tire in vain (Darling)<br />
I&#8217;m always there in your lips<br />
I&#8217;m lost there, because my soul feels you<br />
