<p>Drumming hearts and your silent words of love<br />
They still remain in the shades of night<br />
Will you go? Will you ever save my storming soul?<br />
I need to know</p>
<p>Should I live, should I die without your love?<br />
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?<br />
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?<br />
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you</p>
<p>What I lose, what I find without your love?<br />
What I say, what I hide without your love?<br />
What I have in my mind without your love?<br />
Tell me what I have to do, since I love you</p>
<p>Fly with me, take my wings and dream away<br />
The stars will lead to the heavens&#8217; way<br />
One&#8217;s for sure, there&#8217;s a thousand ways to say goodbye<br />
What you&#8217;ll decide?</p>
<p>Should I live, should I die without your love?<br />
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?<br />
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?<br />
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you</p>
<p>What I lose, what I find without your love?<br />
What I say, what I hide without your love?<br />
What I have in my mind without your love?<br />
Tell me what I have to do, since I love you</p>
<p>Should I live, should I die without your love?<br />
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?<br />
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?<br />
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you</p>
<p>Should I live, should I die without your love?<br />
Should I smile, should I cry without your love?<br />
Should I fall, should I fly without your love?<br />
All I can is only living for you, breathing for you</p>
<p>What I lose, what I find without your love?<br />
What I say, what I hide without your love?<br />
What I have in my mind without your love?<br />
Tell me what I have to do, because I love you</p>
