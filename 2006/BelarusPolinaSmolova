<p>All I tell you, Ma &#8211; my heart on fire<br />
Say me no more that he&#8217;s an arrant liar<br />
I feel so safe, &#8217;cause I know he&#8217;s good<br />
The guys before him were a sort of junk food</p>
<p>Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I miss him?<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, yes, I need only him<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I love him?<br />
So by now my doubts are over<br />
I know for sure that he&#8217;s my dream</p>
<p>All I beg you, Mama &#8211; some comprehension<br />
We got like strangers, due to the tension<br />
Just remember yourself in your teens<br />
And all years after, here is what it means</p>
<p>Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I miss him?<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, yes I need only him<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I love him?<br />
So by now my doubts are over<br />
I know for sure that he&#8217;s my&#8230;</p>
<p>Never say me, Mama &#8211; he is too dangerous<br />
Love can make us broken, but it makes us fly<br />
Let me love him Mama, don&#8217;t sigh, please don&#8217;t cry<br />
Be my friend, oh Mama, the passion is right</p>
<p>Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I miss him?<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, yes, I need only him<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I love him?<br />
So by now my doubts are over<br />
I know for sure that he&#8217;s my&#8230;</p>
<p>Mama, Mama, Mama<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama<br />
So by now my doubts are over<br />
I know for sure that he&#8217;s my&#8230;</p>
<p>Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I miss him?<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, yes, I need only him<br />
Mama, Mama, Mama, can&#8217;t you see how I love him?<br />
So by now my doubts are over</p>
<p>I know for sure that he&#8217;s my&#8230;<br />
I know for sure that he&#8217;s my&#8230;<br />
I know for sure that he&#8217;s my dream</p>
