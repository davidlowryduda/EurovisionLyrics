<p>Every song is a cry for love<br />
Every voice can arise above<br />
So don&#8217;t be afraid, just show what you&#8217;re made of<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love</p>
<p>Every day is a brand new start<br />
Every night you could fall apart<br />
Anytime you doubt the truth that&#8217;s in your heart<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love</p>
<p>Being strong, being tough<br />
Never tender, always rough<br />
It was never enough for me</p>
<p>In the dead of the night<br />
Only love can hold you tight<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love</p>
<p>Every kiss is a call for hope<br />
Every touch means you&#8217;re not alone<br />
You don&#8217;t always have to make it on your own<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love</p>
<p>Being strong, being tough<br />
Never tender, always rough<br />
It was never enough for me</p>
<p>In the dead of the night<br />
Only love can hold you tight<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love<br />
Sing it out: every song is a cry for love</p>
