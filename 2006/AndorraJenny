I never felt at the end of the way before<br />
And now I know it is<br />
There is nothing we could save<br />
Now I know that this time I lost the game<br />
The end arrived</p>
<p>And I know there is no solution<br />
I&#8217;ll look for a reason to walk out of this world without you</p>
<p>Without you, without you<br />
From feeling in heaven, I went to hell<br />
Without you, without you<br />
The nights alone in my bed are so long<br />
Without you, without you</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know how I could escape<br />
I want to get away from reality<br />
Forget my past, simply walk on<br />
Even though I know that at the end I will win</p>
<p>Forgetting you hurt me<br />
Not wanting to know about what happened<br />
It&#8217;s difficult to know that what is waiting for me is hard<br />
Without you by my side</p>
<p>I know that I can&#8217;t dream<br />
The past passed and doesn&#8217;t come back<br />
I need to look forward, I need to learn to love<br />
Without you</p>
<p>Without you, without you<br />
From feeling in heaven I went to hell<br />
Without you, without you<br />
The nights alone in my bed are so long<br />
Without you, without you</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know how I could escape<br />
I want to get away from reality<br />
Forget my past, simply walk on<br />
Even though I know that at the end I will win</p>
<p>Without you, without you<br />
From feeling in heaven I went to hell<br />
Without you, without you<br />
I lost this game, forgetting what I am<br />
Without you, without you</p>
<p>Now I know that I&#8217;m able to escape<br />
I&#8217;m able to get away from reality<br />
Forget my past, simply walk on<br />
Even though you know that at the end, I won</p>
<p>Without you, without you, without you<br />
