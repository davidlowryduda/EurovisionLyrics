<p>(&#8220;What did you learn at school today?&#8221;)<br />
(That&#8217;s what the teachers used to say) Oh yeah<br />
(But they don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t understand, do they?)</p>
<p>(Why do they always give advice?) Always<br />
(Saying: &#8220;Just be nice, always think twice&#8221;)<br />
(When it&#8217;s been a long time since they had a teenage life) Let&#8217;s go</p>
<p>(&#8220;What did you learn at school today?&#8221;) What did you learn?<br />
(That&#8217;s what the teachers used to say) What did you learn?<br />
(But they don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t understand, do they?)</p>
<p>(Why do they always give advice?) Always, always<br />
(Saying: &#8220;Just be nice, always think twice&#8221;)<br />
(When it&#8217;s been a long time since they had a teenage life)</p>
<p>Dwellin&#8217; on the past, from back when I was young<br />
Thinkin&#8217; of my school days and tryin&#8217; to write this song<br />
Classroom schemes and dreams, man, they couldn&#8217;t save me<br />
&#8216;Cause my days were numbered when I signed down on Avy</p>
<p>Teenage kicks running out, what could we do?<br />
I still show respect to my boys who made it through<br />
And getting told off Mr T how my life would be<br />
Then giving him a signal, so everyone could see</p>
<p>Sunshine and shade, those girls I&#8217;d serenade<br />
Thinkin&#8217; of those sixth form chicks that misbehave (Whatever)<br />
Hopin&#8217; that those days would go on and on forever<br />
Every day something new, just friends runnin&#8217; together</p>
<p>But suddenly school ends, your teenage life&#8217;s gone<br />
All your mates are growin&#8217; up, now they&#8217;re movin&#8217; on<br />
And now I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; back, I&#8217;ll tell you what I know<br />
Do you listen to your teacher? No, I don&#8217;t think so</p>
<p>(&#8220;What did you learn at school today?&#8221;) Yeah, yeah<br />
(That&#8217;s what the teachers used to say)<br />
(But they don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t understand, do they?)</p>
<p>(Why do they always give advice?)<br />
(Saying: &#8220;Just be nice, always think twice&#8221;)<br />
(When it&#8217;s been a long time since they had a teenage life)</p>
<p>Now if you give the kids time, together they will shine<br />
Yeah, yeah (Ooh&#8230; shine)<br />
We all will shine, hear me now<br />
And if you treat the kids fine, they won&#8217;t do the crime<br />
No, no (Won&#8217;t do the crime)</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<p>Now my bad old ways were durin&#8217; my school days<br />
Messin&#8217; with those grade A&#8217;s, my life is just a haze<br />
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; through the struggle, five ten and kickin&#8217; back<br />
So I could lock the flow, lace it up now on the track</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I felt the pain whilst chasin&#8217; all the fame<br />
I&#8217;m being told I&#8217;m nothin&#8217;, just a player in the game<br />
But now I walk tall, stand proud for you to see<br />
I&#8217;m drivin&#8217; these fast cars, it&#8217;s five stars for me</p>
<p>(&#8220;What did you learn at school today?&#8221;)<br />
Just take your turn, you gotta learn<br />
(That&#8217;s what the teachers used to say)<br />
(But they don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t understand, do they?)<br />
They don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;</p>
<p>(Why do they always give advice?) Always givin&#8217; advice, yeah<br />
(Saying: &#8220;Just be nice, always think twice&#8221;)<br />
(When it&#8217;s been a long time since they had a teenage life)</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah<br />
(When it&#8217;s been a long time since they had a teenage life)</p>
