<p>When life is a road goin&#8217; nowhere<br />
I&#8217;m alone, though you&#8217;re gonna be right here<br />
You&#8217;re my baby<br />
When life is a road goin&#8217; somewhere<br />
All alone, I have to hold on to go on</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window<br />
What about the sun you made shine?<br />
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window<br />
What about us? Tell me why<br />
I still can&#8217;t see where&#8217;s the rainbow</p>
<p>And maybe somebody someday<br />
Turns back home, but it&#8217;s gonna be a long way<br />
It&#8217;s been a long day<br />
And maybe somebody someway<br />
Highs and lows, it&#8217;s always the same thing anyway</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window<br />
What about the sun you made shine?<br />
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window<br />
What about us? Tell me why<br />
I still can&#8217;t see where&#8217;s the rainbow</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find the words, lose my nerve<br />
And grass just turns to stone (Grass just turns to stone)<br />
When all hopes are high, I have my pride<br />
Show you what I&#8217;m really like inside</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window)<br />
What about the sun you made shine?<br />
What about the rain you cried on my pillow?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window<br />
What about us? Tell me why<br />
I still can&#8217;t see where&#8217;s the rainbow</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lookin&#8217; through my window<br />
What about us? Tell me why<br />
I still can&#8217;t see where&#8217;s the rainbow<br />
I still can&#8217;t see where&#8217;s the rainbow</p>
