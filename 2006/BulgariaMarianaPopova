<p>(Honey, honey, honey, honey)<br />
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)<br />
(Please let me cry, just let me cry)</p>
<p>Told you I was aware<br />
I have feelings to share with you</p>
<p>Something&#8217;s over for good<br />
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)<br />
Love, passion, cheerful mood<br />
(Honey, honey) The truth</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say goodbye<br />
And never back again, let me cry<br />
I wanted you, you wanted to lie<br />
I knew that it would happen this way, yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>(Honey, honey, honey, honey)<br />
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)<br />
(Please let me cry, just let me cry) Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Learning how to obey<br />
(Honey, honey, honey, honey)<br />
Lost my heart and my face<br />
(Honey, honey) My soul</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say goodbye<br />
And never back again, let me cry<br />
I wanted you, you wanted to lie<br />
I knew that it would happen this way, yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say goodbye<br />
And never back again, let me cry<br />
The fear is gonna cure all my pain<br />
I knew that, I knew that, it happened this way&#8230;</p>
