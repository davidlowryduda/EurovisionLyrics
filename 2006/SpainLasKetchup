One Bloody Mary, please</p>
<p>I swear to Dior that I didn&#8217;t want to, but he&#8217;s stuck on me<br />
Everything was clean and certain<br />
I was the other woman, the fool, he&#8217;s a bastard<br />
A mediocre showoff</p>
<p>I made myself marvellous, I dumped him<br />
Wicked martini boy<br />
The unfortunate boy has a lot of fiery words<br />
But this one&#8217;s not going to deceive me</p>
<p>I may be from an underground slum<br />
But my heart has declared to you<br />
Duty free, duty free, duty free<br />
One Bloody Mary, please</p>
<p>I spend the hours dancing<br />
And he, desperate in the bar, drinking and drinking<br />
His look at me is a killer, I have him worked up<br />
He&#8217;s dying inside himself and I&#8217;m crazy</p>
<p>I may be from an underground slum<br />
But my heart has declared to you<br />
Duty free, duty free, duty free<br />
One Bloody Mary, please</p>
<p>There could have been a good tease<br />
It looked pluperfect<br />
But see, your time is over<br />
The night starts again</p>
<p>The moon changed direction, and I saw myself staggering<br />
Frantically looking for ambiance<br />
And see, what&#8217;s the point of this?<br />
Again you and me, face to face</p>
<p>I may be from an underground slum<br />
But my heart has declared to you<br />
Duty free, duty free, duty free<br />
One Bloody Mary, please</p>
<p>There could have been a good tease<br />
It looked pluperfect<br />
But see, your time is over<br />
The night starts again</p>
<p>There could have been a good tease<br />
It looked pluperfect<br />
But see, your time is over<br />
The night starts again</p>
<p>One Bloody Mary, please<br />
