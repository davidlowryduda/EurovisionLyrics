<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Down a field, a scent of wind<br />
And pain follows me like a shadow<br />
Are you sighing after me somewhere?<br />
Where are you hidden from me?</p>
<p>Place rosemary in your hair<br />
And a flower from an old fountain<br />
Layla, could you love another?</p>
<p>If they propose to you tomorrow<br />
Know that I won&#8217;t be there<br />
Sorrows are easily forgiven<br />
But only love never is</p>
<p>Could you love another?</p>
<p>Dove, my dove<br />
Bring her tears instead of a song<br />
I&#8217;m leaving, as if guilty<br />
For loving who I&#8217;m not allowed</p>
<p>Dove, my dove<br />
Bring her tears instead of a song<br />
I&#8217;m leaving, as if guilty<br />
For loving you who I&#8217;m not allowed</p>
<p>For loving you, Lejla<br />
(Dove, my dove)<br />
