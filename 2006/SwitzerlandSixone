<p>Everybody has a dream, what will come and what will be<br />
And hopes it soon will be reality<br />
But a dream is not enough, there&#8217;s so much we gotta do<br />
To overcome the bitter blue</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause we all know one hand alone can never move a rock of stone<br />
It takes us all, me and you</p>
<p>If we all give a little, if we all give a little<br />
We can make this world a home for everyone<br />
If we all give a little, we can dry a million tears<br />
And some hope will grow out of many fears</p>
<p>Everybody has some strength they could spend on someone weak<br />
Don&#8217;t let life be a game of hide-and-seek<br />
Everyone has things to give to someone just to carry on<br />
And with our help, to overcome</p>
<p>We all have learnt a word alone can never touch a heart of stone<br />
It takes much more, more of us</p>
<p>If we all give a little, if we all give a little<br />
We can make this world a home for everyone<br />
If we all give a little, we can dry a million tears<br />
And some hope will grow out of many fears</p>
<p>If we give a little love, just believe it&#8217;s really worth<br />
Many million hearts are beating on this earth</p>
<p>If we all give a little, if we all give a little<br />
We can make this world a home for everyone (For everyone)<br />
If we all give a little, we can dry a million tears</p>
<p>And some hope will grow (It will grow forever)<br />
Out of many fears (If we stand together)<br />
If we give a little, just a little<br />
(If we give a little love) Give a little love</p>
<p>If we all give a little (Just a little love)<br />
All give a little (If we give a)<br />
(A little) Love</p>
