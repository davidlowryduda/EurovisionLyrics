(Haya&#8230; ha haya&#8230; haya&#8230;)<br />
(Come with me into the summer night)</p>
<p>Only I can catch your glance<br />
Show my claws in the kiss you got<br />
Excite you, so you turn into fire<br />
Come here, I know you want to</p>
<p>Haya&#8230; ha haya&#8230; haya&#8230;<br />
Come with me into the summer night<br />
Haya&#8230; ha hayaya&#8230; haya&#8230;<br />
Nothing is hidden tonight</p>
<p>Only I know all that you are<br />
Give you a spark, I see you are near<br />
Float with me, let everything turn into fire<br />
Come here, I know you want to</p>
<p>Haya&#8230; ha haya&#8230; haya&#8230;<br />
Come with me into the summer night<br />
Haya&#8230; ha hayaya&#8230; haya&#8230;<br />
Nothing is hidden tonight</p>
<p>No one knows, the wind is playing<br />
The moon looks away, and we are everything</p>
<p>Haya&#8230; ha haya&#8230; haya&#8230;<br />
Come with me into the summer night<br />
Haya&#8230; ha hayaya&#8230; haya&#8230;<br />
Nothing is hidden tonight<br />
