<p>In a world that is beeping and blaring<br />
Growing louder every day<br />
I cover my ears<br />
But none of the noise will go away (Away)</p>
<p>Sirens, barking dogs<br />
Thank God for the one and only sound<br />
That turns around and makes it right</p>
<p>I hear your heart whisper to me<br />
No matter where I may happen to be, yeah<br />
Sending me love and shining it through<br />
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?</p>
<p>I hear your heart whisper to me<br />
No matter where I may happen to be, yeah<br />
Sending me love and shining it through<br />
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?</p>
<p>Oh, as sensitive people we&#8217;re trampled<br />
Almost everywhere we go<br />
There are days (When we will die) when we&#8217;ll die<br />
If one more stranger tells us no</p>
<p>So I hope your shadows melt away<br />
As you say they&#8217;ve done before<br />
Just like the one and only sound<br />
That turns around for me once more</p>
<p>I hear your heart whisper to me<br />
No matter where I may happen to be<br />
Sending me love and shining it through<br />
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?</p>
<p>I hear your heart whisper to me<br />
No matter where I may happen to be<br />
Sending me love and shining it through<br />
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?</p>
<p>I hear your heart<br />
Mine too?<br />
I hear your heart</p>
<p>A violin on a summer night<br />
On a full moon mountain top<br />
Couldn&#8217;t sound as sweet as you do<br />
Don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t stop</p>
<p>I hear your heart whisper to me<br />
No matter where I may happen to be<br />
Sending me love and shining it through<br />
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?</p>
<p>I hear your heart whisper to me<br />
No matter where I may happen to be<br />
Sending me love and shining it through<br />
I hear your heart, can you hear mine too?</p>
