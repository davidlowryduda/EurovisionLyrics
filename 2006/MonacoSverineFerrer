<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Underneath the caress of the sun<br />
Between heaven and sea, forget your ordeals<br />
And if life leads you by boat<br />
Let yourself go and come dancing</p>
<p>If your love is in thousand pieces<br />
And your heart empty, your luck below zero<br />
I have what you need to take care of yourself<br />
That&#8217;s to have a good stretch</p>
<p>Move, move your hands, your body and your back<br />
Let me sway until the end of the summer<br />
Move, move your hands, your body and your back<br />
To the music that makes us fall in love</p>
<p>Hey oh, coco dance<br />
It&#8217;s the music of love<br />
Hey oh, coco dance<br />
It&#8217;s the dance of love</p>
<p>(Ah&#8230;)<br />
Tahiti on the Windward Islands<br />
The golden sand on my tanned skin<br />
We&#8217;re indeed closer to paradise<br />
To go dance the tāmūrē</p>
<p>Move, move your hands, your body and your back<br />
Let me sway until the end of the summer<br />
Move, move your hands, your body and your back<br />
To the music that makes us fall in love</p>
<p>Hey oh, coco dance<br />
It&#8217;s the music of love<br />
Hey oh, coco dance<br />
It&#8217;s the dance of love</p>
<p>The dance of love<br />
Hey oh (Join us in our dance)</p>
<p>Hey oh, coco dance<br />
(Join us in our dance)<br />
Hey oh, coco dance<br />
(Join us in our dance)</p>
<p>Hey oh, coco dance<br />
It&#8217;s the music of love<br />
Hey oh, coco dance<br />
It&#8217;s the dance of love</p>
<p>Coco dance<br />
