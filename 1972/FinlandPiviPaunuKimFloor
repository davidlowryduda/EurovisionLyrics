Do you remember that sweetest night<br />
The lovely day and the beautiful evening<br />
The moment, when you took my hand first time<br />
To your own warm hand</p>
<p>We walked together only a while<br />
Through a little park, over an old bridge<br />
That little moment was enough to give us happiness then</p>
<p>We met amid the crowd<br />
A coincidence? No, I know it<br />
Destiny brought love in front of us and the land of happiness</p>
<p>Even sorrow is partly happiness<br />
It just has to be realized as part of life<br />
Why would a human otherwise have a skill to laugh?</p>
<p>We walked together only a while<br />
Through a little park, over an old bridge<br />
That little moment was enough to give us happiness then</p>
<p>Did I see you in a dream before?<br />
I think that was the reason for my feeling<br />
I have earlier lived a little moment too</p>
<p>All that must still be just a dream<br />
Park, bridge, and the warm hand of yours<br />
In a second I lived a life almost eternal</p>
<p>La la la la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
La la la la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
La la la la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
La la la la la la la la la la la&#8230;<br />
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la&#8230;</p>
<p>Hey, hey<br />
