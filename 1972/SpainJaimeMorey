It&#8217;s dawning<br />
The rain wets slowly my awakening<br />
People walk by my loneliness without stopping</p>
<p>It&#8217;s dawning<br />
It seems like the sky became grey for us<br />
Because of the sad moment when I heard your goodbye</p>
<p>I know a place beyond the sea<br />
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn<br />
Our boat will sail towards that light<br />
On your trusted sea<br />
With a wind of hope for the day of tomorrow</p>
<p>Listen<br />
Let&#8217;s try to start over again today, why not?<br />
If you want to, friendship and love will be our flag</p>
<p>It&#8217;s dawning<br />
Let&#8217;s search, search for new blue colours in the sky<br />
Let&#8217;s win the battle against incomprehension</p>
<p>I know a place beyond the sea<br />
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn<br />
Our boat will sail towards that light<br />
On your trusted sea<br />
With a wind of hope for the day of tomorrow</p>
<p>I know a place beyond the sea<br />
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn<br />
I know a place beyond the sea<br />
Where the day shines brighter in the dawn<br />
