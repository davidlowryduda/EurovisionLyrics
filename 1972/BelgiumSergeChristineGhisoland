We love passionately or not at all<br />
Love is nothing when it doesn&#8217;t drive crazy<br />
But whatever we say to flowers<br />
We love each other a bit much and we believe it</p>
<p>When I pick (When I pick)<br />
A wildflower (A wildflower)<br />
It&#8217;s only in the wind (It&#8217;s only in the wind)<br />
That I defoliate it (That I defoliate it)</p>
<p>A bit much: those words scared us<br />
It&#8217;s never enough in the grey of the heart<br />
Love is nothing when it doesn&#8217;t drive us crazy<br />
We love passionately or not at all</p>
