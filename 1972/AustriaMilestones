Don&#8217;t stay in the woods, butterfly<br />
And don&#8217;t fly astray at night<br />
The moon is wrong, its shadows<br />
In the dawn are not a help</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stay in the woods<br />
Don&#8217;t stay in the woods<br />
Don&#8217;t stay in the woods</p>
<p>Dance around the lights, butterfly<br />
Your colours flame up<br />
The night is dead, in your dance<br />
Life is bright like the day</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall into the sun<br />
Don&#8217;t fall into the sun<br />
Don&#8217;t fall into the sun</p>
<p>Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by<br />
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt<br />
Don&#8217;t you hear it? A wing breaks<br />
A whisper promises the light</p>
<p>Your day is bright, so dance quickly<br />
It lasts just a wing beat<br />
Dance around the lights, butterfly<br />
Soon the evening fog will come</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall into the sun<br />
Don&#8217;t fall into the sun<br />
Don&#8217;t fall into the sun</p>
<p>Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by<br />
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt<br />
Don&#8217;t you hear it? A wing breaks<br />
A whisper promises the light</p>
<p>Butterfly in the wind, like the time passing by<br />
Like sand in the hand, blown away, burnt<br />
Don&#8217;t you hear it? A wing breaks<br />
A whisper promises the light<br />
