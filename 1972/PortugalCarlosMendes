<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
May come the sun, the wine, the flowers<br />
Tides, songs, all colours<br />
May wars be forgotten thanks to love</p>
<p>May already come the embraces<br />
Put on the smile of a clown<br />
Forget sadness and tiredness</p>
<p>May come all the parties<br />
And may nobody forget the kisses<br />
May come the gifts of joy<br />
And may the party last until daybreak</p>
<p>May no expenses be spared<br />
May all sadness be kept far away<br />
May there be bread, wine and roses on the table</p>
<p>May blankets and rugs be brought along<br />
May the wine flow in our throats<br />
And may the party last all night long</p>
<p>May everyone come out of free will<br />
May all longing be forgotten<br />
May young and old people come<br />
Without giving me any advice</p>
<p>May everyone come out of free will<br />
May all longing be forgotten<br />
May young and old people come<br />
Without giving me any advice<br />
