Everyone builds themselves their own world<br />
Everyone dreams themselves their own dream<br />
Their own road that leads to love<br />
That leads to happiness, everyone finds themselves</p>
<p>Music and you, that&#8217;s the world<br />
In which I found happiness<br />
Music and you, that&#8217;s the world<br />
In which the sun always shines</p>
<p>Like a beautiful vision from a dream<br />
I surrender to it completely<br />
Music and you, music and you<br />
And an anthem of an eternal love</p>
<p>That day has to come<br />
Your day, your happy night<br />
And the pain which you hold<br />
In the depths of your hears, has to go</p>
<p>Music and you, that&#8217;s the world<br />
In which I found happiness<br />
Music and you, that&#8217;s the world<br />
In which the sun always shines</p>
<p>Like a beautiful vision from a dream<br />
I surrender to it completely<br />
Music and you, music and you<br />
And an anthem of an eternal love</p>
<p>Music and you, music and you<br />
And an anthem of an eternal love<br />
