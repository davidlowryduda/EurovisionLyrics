Those were the days of the rainbow<br />
When the winter ended, the good weather came back<br />
And you, with the moon and the stars in your eyes<br />
Felt a hand touching your skin</p>
<p>And while you went crazy for the scent of flowers<br />
The night was lit with a thousand colours<br />
Outspread on the grass, like someone who&#8217;s dreaming<br />
You were lying, little girl, but you got up as a woman</p>
<p>Now you have grown bigger<br />
You&#8217;re stronger and safer<br />
And the sweet adventure already started</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re little girls, old friends<br />
Who meet in group for playing<br />
And still dream on a moon beam</p>
<p>You live your life as an important woman<br />
Because at the age of sixteen, you already feel grown up<br />
But one day you&#8217;ll see that every woman is mature</p>
<p>At the right time and with the right measure<br />
And on your course you&#8217;ll find love<br />
You leave the past behind for better times<br />
