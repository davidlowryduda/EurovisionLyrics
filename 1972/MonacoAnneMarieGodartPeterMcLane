How we love each other, how we love each other<br />
How we love each other, my love<br />
The poem of &#8216;I love you&#8217;<br />
Is the same every day</p>
<p>How we love each other, how we love each other<br />
Without problem, without talking<br />
About the same old subject<br />
How we love each other, my love</p>
<p>He has blond dreams and under his long hair<br />
He has his head full of violins<br />
She has a pounding heart because she already knows<br />
How he will take her in his arms</p>
<p>How we love each other, how we love each other<br />
How we love each other, my love<br />
The poem of &#8216;I love you&#8217;<br />
Is the same every day</p>
<p>How we love each other, how we love each other<br />
Happiness arrived<br />
They had dreamt so long about each other<br />
They finally found each other</p>
<p>Lovers of Paris, from the North or from the South of France<br />
Two by two, they smiled delighted<br />
Lovers from everywhere, they come to us<br />
Singing the song in unison</p>
<p>Lala lala&#8230; lala lala&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lalala&#8230;</p>
<p>How we love each other, how we love each other<br />
How we love each other, my love<br />
Without problem, about the same old subject<br />
How we love each other, my love<br />
