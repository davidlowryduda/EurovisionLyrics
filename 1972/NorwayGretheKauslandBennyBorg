Saving up money, treasures or gold<br />
Inherit a castle, that we can, but what is that<br />
Compared to everyday happiness?</p>
<p>Travel the world, feel free<br />
Land on the moon, that we can, but what is that?<br />
Open your eyes and you&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
<p>Little things, little things, to be of use<br />
Little things, little things, that&#8217;s to listen<br />
Little things, little things, to be happy</p>
<p>Little things, little things, to talk about the weather<br />
Little things, little things, to meet loved ones<br />
Little things, little things, it&#8217;s a little song</p>
<p>Look forward to every day, there are so many different ones<br />
There are days better than you expect<br />
Cut down on your demands, stop all the stressing<br />
Relax and smile, there is no doubt that</p>
<p>Little things, little things, to take a walk on the beach<br />
Little things, little things, to write in the sand<br />
Little things, little things, to watch a sunset</p>

<p>To watch a sunset, to watch a sunset</p>
<p>Little things, little things, little things, little things<br />
