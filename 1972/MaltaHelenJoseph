I searched for wise men, philosophers and poets<br />
So I could ask them this question:<br />
&#8220;What is youth&#8217;s big love?&#8221;<br />
I felt the answer in my heart</p>
<p>Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss<br />
Something that touches your heart and they call it &#8220;kiss&#8221;<br />
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar<br />
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut</p>
<p>And while the heart beats with enthusiasm<br />
And feels the veins burn with fire<br />
Whether it&#8217;s given straight or it&#8217;s stolen<br />
In the middle of the night, in the harshest of the day</p>
<p>I went to find the freaks, Hell&#8217;s Angels and the hippies<br />
And I also asked them my question<br />
I always got the same answer from them<br />
And then in the words of all these I came to:</p>
<p>Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss<br />
Something that touches your heart and they call it &#8220;kiss&#8221;<br />
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar<br />
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut</p>
<p>And while the heart beats with enthusiasm<br />
And feels the veins burn with fire<br />
Whether it&#8217;s given straight or it&#8217;s stolen<br />
In the middle of the night, in the harshest of the day</p>
<p>Love is a kiss, a kiss, a kiss<br />
Something that touches your heart and they call it &#8220;kiss&#8221;<br />
Love is a kiss as sweet as sugar<br />
That is pushed by the lips while the eyes are shut</p>
<p>The Italians and also the Spanish<br />
The German, English and Maltese<br />
I asked them all what they understood under love<br />
And their answer is this:</p>
<p>Love is a kiss, a kiss and a kiss<br />
