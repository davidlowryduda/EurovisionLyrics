Only love lets us live<br />
Days in bright sunshine<br />
Which only love can give us<br />
Only those who love will never be lonely</p>
<p>We&#8217;re waiting and we&#8217;re hoping and we&#8217;re dreaming<br />
The day goes by and takes our dreams along<br />
The night is long and you&#8217;re not with me<br />
But my heart, it finds its way to you</p>
<p>Only love lets us live<br />
Forget and forgive everything<br />
Then you&#8217;ll be forgiven again<br />
Only those who love will never be lonely</p>
<p>Only love lets us live<br />
Days in bright sunshine<br />
Which only love can give us<br />
Only those who love will never be lonely</p>
<p>I knew the paths that we travel<br />
Would be complicated, and that there would be tears<br />
That doesn&#8217;t matter anymore, have you seen the goal?<br />
You&#8217;ll walk along the road of your desire</p>
<p>Only love lets us live<br />
Forget and forgive everything<br />
Then you&#8217;ll be forgiven again<br />
Only those who love will never be lonely</p>
<p>Only love lets us live<br />
Days in bright sunshine<br />
Which only love can give us<br />
Only those who love will never be lonely</p>
<p>Only love lets us live<br />
Days in bright sunshine<br />
Which only love can give us<br />
Only those who love will never be lonely<br />
