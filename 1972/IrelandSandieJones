Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love<br />
Here or beyond me, it&#8217;s eternally with me, the music of love<br />
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach<br />
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that&#8217;s the music of love</p>
<p>Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love<br />
The little bird sings it, the wind plays it for me, the music of love<br />
Morning or midday, I always hear it<br />
Listen to the tune, you are my sweetheart, that&#8217;s the music of love</p>
<p>This is the Land of Eternal Youth and wings are in place of my legs<br />
Now and forever happiness is before me, all around<br />
You are my sweetheart by day and by night<br />
And every single moment of my life</p>
<p>Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love<br />
Here or beyond me, it&#8217;s eternally with me, the music of love<br />
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach<br />
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that&#8217;s the music of love</p>
<p>Listen, listen, I hear it again, the music of love<br />
Here or beyond me, it&#8217;s eternally with me, the music of love<br />
In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach<br />
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that&#8217;s the music of love</p>
<p>In the centre of the lovely city, beside the river or on the beach<br />
I hear the tune, you are my sweetheart, that&#8217;s the music of love<br />
