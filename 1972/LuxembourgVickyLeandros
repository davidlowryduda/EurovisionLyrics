You go away, love has for you the smile of another<br />
I would want to, but can&#8217;t be mad at you<br />
From now on, you&#8217;ll forget me<br />
It&#8217;s not your fault, but still you should know</p>
<p>That after you, I couldn&#8217;t live anymore<br />
I would only live remembering you<br />
After you, I&#8217;ll have wet eyes<br />
Empty hands, a joyless heart</p>
<p>With you, I&#8217;ve learnt to laugh<br />
And my laughs only came by you<br />
After you, I&#8217;ll only be the shadow<br />
Of your shadow, after you</p>
<p>Even if I settle down one day<br />
If I keep the promise that unites two beings for always<br />
After you, I could perhaps give my tenderness<br />
But not my love anymore</p>
<p>After you, I couldn&#8217;t live anymore<br />
I would only live remembering you<br />
After you, I&#8217;ll have wet eyes<br />
Empty hands, a joyless heart</p>
<p>With you, I&#8217;ve learnt to laugh<br />
And my laughs only came by you<br />
After you, I&#8217;ll only be the shadow<br />
Of your shadow, after you<br />
