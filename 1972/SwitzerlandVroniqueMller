Wild and tender words<br />
It&#8217;s the song of my love<br />
My heart was charmed<br />
By the song of my love<br />
My love</p>
<p>She&#8217;s there throughout my life<br />
She waits for me in the wind and under the rain<br />
In the blue of a blue sky in full noon<br />
In my boring night so far from him</p>
<p>One day, it was December<br />
I went alone under the rain<br />
We&#8217;ve found each other<br />
To share the same shelter</p>
<p>His hand took mine<br />
We loved each other the same day<br />
Time, hope, sorrow<br />
It&#8217;s the song of my love<br />
My love</p>
<p>She&#8217;s there throughout my life<br />
She waits for me in the wind and under the rain<br />
In the blue of a blue sky in full noon<br />
In my boring night so far from him</p>
<p>Wild and tender words<br />
It&#8217;s the song of my love<br />
My heart was charmed<br />
By the song of my love</p>
<p>Di di di da da&#8230;<br />
Di di da da da di da da&#8230;<br />
My heart was charmed<br />
By the song of my love<br />
My love<br />
