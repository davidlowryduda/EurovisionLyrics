The morning sun glitters in the bay<br />
The day dawns, and for the last time the Han√∂ lighthouse flashes<br />
Can you see our sailing boat, can you hear the music<br />
As we steer towards a new adventure</p>
<p>Hum a song, sing a melody<br />
Hum a tune that reminds you of summer<br />
Feel the scent of the salty seas</p>
<p>As we&#8217;re humming a song, singing a melody<br />
Humming a tune that reminds you of summer<br />
Sing about a lovely summer&#8217;s day</p>
<p>Wind from the east, steaming waves and whitecaps<br />
Filling sails that flap as we go towards our island</p>
<p>In a bay we cast anchor<br />
Have a dip, have a good time on a flat rock, warmed by the sun<br />
Before we walk home at an easy pace<br />
On the island on a nice summer&#8217;s night</p>
<p>Hum a song, sing a melody<br />
Hum a tune that reminds you of summer<br />
Feel the scent of the salty seas</p>
<p>As we&#8217;re humming a song, singing a melody<br />
Humming a tune that reminds you of summer<br />
Sing about a lovely summer, summer</p>
<p>Lalala la lalala la&#8230;<br />
Lalala lala lalala lala&#8230;<br />
La la lalala lala lalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Lalalala la lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala lala lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Sing about a lovely summer<br />
Lovely day, lovely summer&#8217;s day<br />
