Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
In love, it&#8217;s always like that</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
A song that we forget<br />
But that one day will return</p>
<p>Some pages of a life<br />
That are ripped out, and like this<br />
The world will spin round</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
We love each other so much, you and me</p>
<p>Our story can be written in a few words:<br />
I love you, you love me, what&#8217;s more beautiful?<br />
Why do we have to defend ourselves?<br />
Why try to understand?<br />
Because we immediately sing:</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
Happiness is never so far away</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
The illusions of today<br />
May come true tomorrow</p>
<p>Either the storms or the rain<br />
The sorrows or the concerns<br />
After all, that&#8217;s nothing</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
But three notes in my refrain</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
In love, it&#8217;s always like that</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
We say no, then we say yes<br />
Looking several times</p>
<p>Some pages of a life<br />
That are ripped out, and like this<br />
The world will spin round</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
As much as we love each other</p>
<p>Come-come-comedy<br />
As, as, as they say<br />
