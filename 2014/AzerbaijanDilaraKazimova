<p>Someone&#8217;s selling garden roses down the square<br />
People gathering by to breathe the morning air<br />
But no one sees the bitter cold and shivering empty hands</p>
<p>A school girl running by and trying to beat the bell<br />
People dropping, tossing coins in wishing wells<br />
But no one cares for dreams that don&#8217;t fit into our world</p>
<p>Maybe nightfall darkens skies<br />
And maybe teardrops stain our eyes<br />
But may the slightest light start a fire</p>
<p>A soldier in the hands of a forgotten mess<br />
Digging out the burning bullets in his chest<br />
So eager, bold and noble &#8211; printing footsteps on this earth</p>
<p>Maybe nightfall darkens skies<br />
And maybe teardrops stain our eyes<br />
But may the slightest light<br />
Start a fire, start a fire</p>
<p>But may the slightest light start a fire</p>
