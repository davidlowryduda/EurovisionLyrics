<p>I gotta feeling that I wanna go loud<br />
Make my move and let it all get out<br />
I gotta feeling that I wanna go wild<br />
Take my hand, baby I&#8217;ve got all night</p>
<p>Take me now, you know I want you<br />
Hold me now, &#8217;cause I can&#8217;t stop it<br />
Take me up where we can do this<br />
To the stars tonight</p>
<p>Where do we go now?<br />
To the sky, you and I, beautiful<br />
Where do we go now?<br />
To the stars, shine so bright, into the sky<br />
Where do we go now?</p>
<p>Where, where do we go?<br />
Where, where do we go?<br />
Where, where do we go?</p>
<p>I gotta feeling that I need your whole time<br />
You make me feel, that is why you hold mine<br />
I gotta feeling that we both could shine<br />
Held together by the hand of life</p>
<p>Take me now, you know I want you<br />
Hold me now, &#8217;cause I can&#8217;t stop it<br />
Take me up where we can do this<br />
To the stars tonight</p>
<p>Where do we go now?<br />
To the sky, you and I, beautiful<br />
Where do we go now?<br />
To the stars, shine so bright, into the sky</p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t wanna live without you for another day<br />
And if what said it wasn&#8217;t means that you will have to stay<br />
You better hold me, dance me, sway like this forever<br />
Take me dancing tonight</p>
<p>Take me now, you know I want you<br />
Hold me now, &#8217;cause I can&#8217;t stop it now</p>
<p>Where, where do we go?<br />
Where, where do we go?<br />
Where, where do we go?</p>
<p>Where do we go now?<br />
To the sky, you and I, beautiful<br />
Where do we go now?<br />
To the stars, shine so bright, into the sky</p>
<p>Where do we go now?<br />
To the stars, shine so bright, into the sky<br />
Where do we go now?</p>
