I&#8217;m missing something, but what?<br />
I want this, I want that<br />
When I&#8217;m asleep I dream in dollars<br />
Every day I have a new suit</p>
<p>At my place everything is new, everything is beautiful<br />
The world is crying behind my curtains<br />
I don&#8217;t care, I live on the top floor<br />
I don&#8217;t even know my maid</p>
<p>There&#8217;s leather in my car<br />
The smell of my fragrance reassures me<br />
I don&#8217;t like showing my emotions<br />
In the fitness room</p>
<p>I lift some weights and dumbbells<br />
My body is a war machine<br />
Everything that I dream of having<br />
I may have everything, it&#8217;s true, but I want</p>
<p>A moustache, moustache, moustache<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I wanna have a moustache, moustache, moustache</em></font><br />
I want a moustache</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
There&#8217;s never enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
There&#8217;s never enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
I want this, I want that<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m still adding it up<br />
The tonnes of things behind my cupboards<br />
I still have some friends<br />
And I even have friends who love me</p>
<p>I tell myself I have it all, I have everything<br />
I&#8217;ve the world at my feet, it&#8217;s crazy<br />
Everything that I dream of having<br />
I may have everything, it&#8217;s true, but I wanted</p>
<p>A moustache, moustache, moustache<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I wanna have a moustache, moustache, moustache</em></font><br />
I want a moustache</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
There&#8217;s never enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
There&#8217;s never enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have</p>
<p>I would give everything I have for a moustache<br />
Now I know what I want, a moustache<br />
I could leave everything, give everything for a moustache<br />
I may have everything, it&#8217;s true, but not what I want</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
There&#8217;s never enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have</p>
<p>I want this, I want that<br />
There&#8217;s never enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s like this, it&#8217;s like that<br />
There&#8217;s always something that I don&#8217;t have<br />
A moustache<br />
