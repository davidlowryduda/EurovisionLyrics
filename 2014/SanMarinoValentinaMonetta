<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a pearl in the shell<br />
Maybe there&#8217;s a story to tell<br />
Maybe we cannot live in peace<br />
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;re under a spell</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a light from above<br />
Maybe there&#8217;s a flight of a dove<br />
When it&#8217;s time<br />
To open the heart of love</p>
<p>Maybe we can try, maybe you and I<br />
Are finally made to overcome<br />
Maybe then one day every soul hears it<br />
We&#8217;ll find a way</p>
<p>And maybe we really are the dream of God<br />
And we woke up in flesh and blood<br />
When our emotions draws for me to go</p>
<p>Or maybe in certain solid ways I feel<br />
I know there&#8217;s nothing stronger than for real<br />
Than falling in love</p>
<p>Maybe you and I are teardrops from the sky<br />
Let&#8217;s fill the sea eternally<br />
Maybe we can try<br />
To challenge the fear of the endless night</p>
<p>And maybe we really are the dream of God<br />
And we woke up in flesh and blood<br />
To find it that it draws for me to go</p>
<p>Or maybe in certain solid ways I feel<br />
I know there&#8217;s nothing stronger than for real<br />
Than falling in love</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a journey in the darkest night<br />
Maybe we can make it to the morning light<br />
Maybe this is it, this is real<br />
And I feel this is right, finally right</p>
<p>And maybe the courage that I find at night<br />
Remember it and sense somehow I fell in love</p>
