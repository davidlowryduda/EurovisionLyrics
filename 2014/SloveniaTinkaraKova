<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Uncertain, inbetween worlds<br />
Round and round, trapped in time<br />
When you already know all the windstorms you&#8217;re playful<br />
But by yourself</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And now I&#8217;m gonna show you how to breathe<br />
I&#8217;m gonna show you how to live<br />
(I&#8217;m gonna hold your heart in hand)<br />
Yeah I&#8217;m gonna make you understand</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You don&#8217;t know, you don&#8217;t know, is it love, is it hate?<br />
What are you changing? (What are we doing?)<br />
You don&#8217;t know, you don&#8217;t, but can you feel it inside?<br />
Feel the roses, feel the pride (Can you believe it?)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Round and round again we&#8230;<br />
Round and round again we go&#8230; oh-oh&#8230;<br />
Round and round again we&#8230;<br />
Round and round again we go&#8230; oh-oh&#8230;</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Is a moment just a circle<br />
Just a song you play on repeat?<br />
If we can&#8217;t change how we&#8217;re living<br />
Isn&#8217;t life just a lie that we feed?</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And now I&#8217;m gonna show you how to breathe<br />
I&#8217;m gonna show you how to live<br />
(I&#8217;m gonna hold your heart in hand)<br />
Yeah I&#8217;m gonna make you understand</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You don&#8217;t know, you don&#8217;t know, is it love, is it hate?<br />

You don&#8217;t know, you don&#8217;t, but can you feel it inside?<br />

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Round and round again we&#8230;<br />
Round and round again we go&#8230; oh-oh&#8230;<br />
Round and round again we&#8230;<br />
Round and round again we go&#8230; oh-oh&#8230;</em></font></p>
<p>When the sky won&#8217;t cover our dreams<br />
We&#8217;re reborn (We will meet)<br />
When the sky won&#8217;t have the right ideas<br />
Again it will be our time (To shine)</p>
<p>Again everything will be the same, again everything will be the same<br />
As it was, oh-oh&#8230;<br />
Only the heart will not be the same anymore<br />
As it was, everything as it was<br />
