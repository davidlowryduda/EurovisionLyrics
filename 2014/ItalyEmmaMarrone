<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I hate being in a hurry, the sounds, the fog<br />
The hanging time of this city<br />
I hate high heels that I absent-mindedly get stuck<br />
In the intrusive manholes of this city</p>
<p>I hate myself in the mirror<br />
Not for the flaw but for stupidity<br />
I love hanging around knowing<br />
To always return to this city</p>
<p>And tell me if there&#8217;s any sense this time<br />
To my useless wandering<br />
And tell me if there really is a destination<br />
Or I have to run for happiness</p>
<p>And I run, run forward and turn back<br />
I escape, I want to take the train<br />
I tighten harder your breath<br />
And I think to myself there are no brakes</p>
<p>I push hard, I&#8217;m not afraid of you<br />
I want it all, I want you<br />
I want you, I want you, I want you</p>
<p>I love the traffic in the centre, parking distracted<br />
Your smile, my instability<br />
I love being offensive for no real reason<br />
Making peace in the evening, turning off the city</p>
<p>And I love myself for this<br />
For self-centeredness without rationality<br />
I love teasing you knowing<br />
To always return to my city</p>
<p>And tell me if there&#8217;s any sense this time<br />
To my useless wandering<br />
And tell me if there really is a destination<br />
Or I have to run for happiness</p>
<p>And I run, run forward and turn back<br />
I escape, I want to take the train<br />
I tighten harder your breath<br />
And I think to myself there are no brakes</p>
<p>I push hard, I&#8217;m not afraid of you<br />
I want it all, I want you<br />
I want you, I want you, I want you</p>
<p>And tell me if you want it, and tell me that you&#8217;re not<br />
Only a confused reflection that I see at the bottom of me</p>
<p>And I run, run forward and turn back<br />
I escape, I want to take the train<br />
I tighten harder your breath<br />
And I think to myself there are no brakes</p>
<p>I push hard, I&#8217;m not afraid of you<br />
I want it all, I want you<br />
I want you, I want you, I want you<br />
