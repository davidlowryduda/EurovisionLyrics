<p>Freedom of life, I will express my soul<br />
Look me in the eye and electrify my bones<br />
I ain&#8217;t gonna leave until you know my name<br />
Stepping out of the shell, now don&#8217;t you step in my way</p>
<p>Build another wall and watch it crumble by your side<br />
Whoa, I&#8217;m coming home</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not holding back, no, I ain&#8217;t wasting time<br />
If you want me near then you must come for the ride<br />
If your sky will fall, I&#8217;ll shelter you from the rain<br />
There&#8217;s not a cloud in the sky that can come in the way</p>
<p>Oh, roaming through fields, I&#8217;m trying to find this new land<br />
It&#8217;s only &#8217;cause I&#8217;m here, I&#8217;m finding gold in my hands<br />
Oh, I&#8217;m coming home<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m coming home</p>
<p>Trying to build up the words to say what you mean to me<br />
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br />
Gonna open your eyes and let you know what I mean</p>
<p>Oh, I&#8230;<br />
Oh, I&#8230;</p>
<p>(Gonna take on this journey, feel the light getting warm)<br />
Gonna take on this journey<br />
(Find the strength I&#8217;ve been searching, keep the beat going strong)<br />
Feel the light getting warm</p>
<p>(Keep the gloves on for fighting, don&#8217;t you knock on my door)<br />
Freedom of life, I will express my soul<br />
(Yeah, the spirit&#8217;s alive, I&#8217;m on the road coming)<br />
I&#8217;m on the road coming</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m coming home<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m coming home</p>
