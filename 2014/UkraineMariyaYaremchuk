<p>I believe that I&#8217;ve loved you<br />
Since the first time that I saw you<br />
Bells rang, angels sang<br />
When the light of the night fell on us we knew<br />
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh</p>
<p>We both knew that you were mine<br />
Now cover me, I&#8217;ll buy us time, time<br />
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br />
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh</p>
<p>Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?<br />
My heart is like a clock, I&#8217;m steady like a rock<br />
Shh, don&#8217;t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop<br />
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love</p>
<p>Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?<br />
My heart is like a clock, I&#8217;m steady like a rock<br />
Shh, don&#8217;t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop<br />
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love</p>
<p>(You wind and wind it with your love)<br />
(You wind and wind it with your love)</p>
<p>Now I know it&#8217;s too hard to<br />
Go tick-tock without the glimpse of you<br />
If you cave in I break<br />
I keep losing my pace in this endless race<br />
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh</p>
<p>They all know that you&#8217;re mine<br />
They can see we belong<br />
Shelter me, you&#8217;ll do fine<br />
Wait for me, I&#8217;ll buy us time</p>
<p>Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?<br />
My heart is like a clock, I&#8217;m steady like a rock<br />
Shh, don&#8217;t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop<br />
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love</p>
<p>Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?<br />
My heart is like a clock, I&#8217;m steady like a rock<br />
Shh, don&#8217;t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop<br />
(My heart is like a clock) Oh, you wind it with your love&#8230;</p>
<p>(Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick-tock?) Ooh&#8230;<br />
(My heart is like a clock, I&#8217;m steady like a rock) You wind it with your love&#8230;<br />
(Shh, don&#8217;t stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop)<br />
(My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love)</p>
<p>Tick-tock</p>
