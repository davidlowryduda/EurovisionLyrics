<p>Remember how we used to be<br />
Floating the skies, it felt so heavenly<br />
We were weightless</p>
<p>We froze to ice and melted down<br />
We chased the stars and fell to the ground<br />
Couldn&#8217;t care less</p>
<p>This feeling inside<br />
You&#8217;re all that I have, I need you back<br />
Do you hear me screaming?</p>
<p>Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)<br />
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t want another to make me high<br />
I want, want you to be amazing lie<br />
Stay amazing lie</p>
<p>You know there&#8217;s nothing I wouldn&#8217;t do<br />
I&#8217;d break the curse of time to be with you<br />
I&#8217;d be fearless</p>
<p>I&#8217;d jump as far as I can see<br />
And beat the perfect storm in the endless sea<br />
Amazing</p>
<p>This feeling inside<br />
You&#8217;re all that I have, I need you back<br />
Do you hear me screaming?</p>
<p>Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)<br />
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t want another to make me high<br />
I want, want you to be amazing lie<br />
Stay amazing lie</p>
<p>This feeling inside<br />
You&#8217;re all that I have, I need you back<br />
We were weightless</p>
<p>Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)<br />
Stay amazing lie (Do you hear me screaming?)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t want another to make me high<br />
I want, want you to be amazing lie<br />
Stay amazing lie</p>
<p>Amazing</p>
