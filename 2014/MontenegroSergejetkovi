<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I seek you not to forget me<br />
When you hug your pillow to dream about me<br />
I seek happiness but it leaves no trace<br />
As if your soul is writing to another</p>
<p>I still love you, know that<br />
In my heart you sleep alone</p>
<p>My world I keep for you<br />
In my world to get you back<br />
So the dawn breaks<br />
With you I only know love</p>
<p>My world I keep for you<br />
In my world, I seek to get you back</p>
<p>Do not grow old alone<br />
In your hands I tie my soul<br />
So the dawn breaks<br />
With you I only know love</p>
<p>I still love you, know that<br />
In my heart there is only you<br />
I still keep for us<br />
A world of love<br />
