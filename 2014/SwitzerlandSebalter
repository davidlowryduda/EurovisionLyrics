<p>Looking for a candidate<br />
You have an option, only one choice<br />
Sipping my drinks, looking around<br />
There&#8217;s so much beauty, oh yes we can</p>
<p>But yet self-confidence is a fragile concept<br />
That often fades away in the night<br />
And there it comes, that unwanted guest<br />
There is no place for you tonight</p>
<p>Want me to go, want me to go<br />
&#8216;Cause you think I&#8217;m lying, &#8217;cause you think I&#8217;m lying<br />
No, open the door<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no</p>
<p>Like an evil satellite<br />
Twisting the truth then leaving us alone<br />
In this mad and moody world<br />
Society without love</p>
<p>I state my heart has been well trained<br />
I&#8217;m gonna be your candidate<br />
I am the hunter and you are the prey<br />
Tonight I&#8217;m gonna eat you up</p>
<p>Want me to go, want me to go<br />
&#8216;Cause you think I&#8217;m lying, &#8217;cause you think I&#8217;m lying<br />
No, open the door<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars</p>
<p>I press my nose to the glass<br />
It&#8217;s raining outside, it&#8217;s raining outside<br />
I would like to storm in<br />
Roar like a lion, roar like a lion</p>
<p>But I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement<br />
I&#8217;m so wet, I&#8217;m dirty<br />
But I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement<br />
It&#8217;s me and my imperfection</p>
<p>Want me to go, want me to go<br />
&#8216;Cause you think I&#8217;m lying, &#8217;cause you think I&#8217;m lying<br />
No, open the door<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no</p>
<p>Want me to go<br />
&#8216;Cause you think I&#8217;m lying, &#8217;cause you think I&#8217;m lying<br />
No, open the door<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no</p>
<p>Want me to go<br />
&#8216;Cause you think I&#8217;m lying, &#8217;cause you think I&#8217;m lying<br />
No, open the door<br />
&#8216;Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no</p>
