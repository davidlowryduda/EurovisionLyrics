<p>Silent, I can&#8217;t wait here silent<br />
Working up a storm inside my head<br />
Nothing, I just stood for nothing<br />
So I fell for every thing you said</p>
<p>Hear the rumble, hear my voice<br />
Silent, I can&#8217;t wait here silent<br />
Gotta make a change and make some noise</p>
<p>Undo my sad<br />
Undo what hurts so bad<br />
Undo my pain<br />
Gonna get out through the rain</p>
<p>I know that I am over you<br />
At last I know what I should do<br />
Undo my sad love</p>
<p>Trouble, baby I&#8217;m in trouble<br />
Every time I look into your eyes<br />
Save me, oh I&#8217;m gonna save me<br />
Faraway from all the crazy lies</p>
<p>Hear the rumble, hear my voice</p>
<p>Undo my sad<br />
Undo what hurts so bad<br />
Undo my pain<br />
Gonna get out through the rain</p>
<p>I know that I am over you<br />
At last I know what I should do<br />
Undo my sad</p>
<p>Undo my sad<br />
Undo what hurts so bad<br />
Undo my pain<br />
Gonna get out through the rain</p>
<p>I know that I am over you<br />
At last I know what I should do<br />
Undo my sad</p>
<p>My sad love, undo</p>
