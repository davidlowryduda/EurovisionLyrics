<p>Driving in the fast lane, counting mile marker signs<br />
The empty seat beside me keeps you on my mind<br />
Livin&#8217; in the heartache was never something I pursued<br />
I can&#8217;t keep on chasing what I can&#8217;t be for you</p>
<p>Ooh skies are black and blue<br />
I&#8217;m thinking about you<br />
Here in the calm after the storm</p>
<p>Tears on the highway, water in my eyes<br />
This rain ain&#8217;t gonna change us, so what&#8217;s the use to cry?<br />
I could say I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t wanna lie<br />
I just wanna know if staying is better than goodbye</p>
<p>Ooh skies are black and blue<br />
I&#8217;m thinking about you<br />
Here in the calm after the storm</p>
<p>Ooh after all that we&#8217;ve been through<br />
There ain&#8217;t nothing new<br />
Here in the calm after the storm</p>
<p>Maybe I can find you down this broken line<br />
Maybe you can find me, I guess we&#8217;ll know in time</p>
<p>Ooh skies are black and blue<br />
I&#8217;m thinking about you<br />
Here in the calm after the storm<br />
There ain&#8217;t nothing new<br />
Here in the calm after the storm</p>
