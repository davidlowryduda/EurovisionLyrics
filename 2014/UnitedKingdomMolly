<p>(Power to the people, oh hey hey)<br />
(Power to the people, oh oh oh oh)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been tired of this thinking (hey)<br />
So I&#8217;ve drowned it out by drinking (oh)<br />
Tastes like a bitter pill but I&#8217;ll just wash it down<br />
With the taste of something sweet that some doctor gave me now</p>
<p>And this is a madness<br />
I&#8217;m not giving in</p>
<p>We&#8217;re shining like diamonds<br />
With fire in our bones<br />
Standing beside you<br />
I&#8217;ve a feeling that I&#8217;ll never walk alone</p>
<p>Oh, we&#8217;re children of the universe, don&#8217;t you know?<br />
Dancing on the edge of time and it&#8217;s ours to own<br />
Children of the uni, children of the uni<br />
Just children of the universe</p>
<p>(Power to the people, oh hey hey)<br />
(Power to the people, oh oh oh oh)<br />
(Power to the people, oh hey hey)<br />
(You know what we want and we&#8217;ve got to get it now)</p>
<p>Something&#8217;s stirring in the silence<br />
And it reeks of passive violence<br />
Hold on tight, this opportunity will take<br />
Put and end to all this suffering before it gets too late</p>
<p>Hopes on the horizon<br />
I&#8217;m not giving in</p>
<p>Oh, we&#8217;re children of the universe, don&#8217;t you know?<br />
Dancing on the edge of time and it&#8217;s ours to own<br />
Children of the uni, children of the uni<br />
Just children of the universe</p>
<p>We&#8217;re shining like diamonds<br />
With love in our hearts<br />
They said it&#8217;s the end but I&#8217;ve a feeling<br />
It might just be the start</p>
<p>As I am awakened<br />
With fire in my bones<br />
Standing beside you<br />
I&#8217;ve a feeling that I&#8217;ll never walk alone</p>
<p>We&#8217;re children of the uni, children of the uni<br />
Children of the universe, don&#8217;t you know?<br />
Yeah, dancing on the edge of time and it&#8217;s ours to own</p>
<p>Children of the uni, children of the uni<br />
&#8216;Cause we are the children of the universe<br />
Children of the uni, children of the uni<br />
Just children of the universe</p>
<p>(Power to the people)</p>
