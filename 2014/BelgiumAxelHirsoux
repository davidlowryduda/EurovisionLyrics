<p>I&#8217;m coming home<br />
I&#8217;m broken-hearted and I need time to shelter<br />
I need your love, a hand to hold<br />
A heart to heal a voice to help me through, through</p>
<p>When hope is low<br />
You find the words to make me feel so much better<br />
When I&#8217;ve had enough, I&#8217;ve had enough of all the tears<br />
And all the hurt I can count on you, only you</p>
<p>And once again, Mother<br />
You are right there, Mother<br />
You are my guiding light<br />
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite<br />
I&#8217;m weak, you&#8217;re bright</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not said enough<br />
But you mean the world to me, you&#8217;re more than a soulmate<br />
And you should know, oh you should know<br />
I&#8217;m so hopeful and so thankful that someday soon<br />
I&#8217;ll shine like you</p>
<p>And once again, Mother<br />
You are right there, Mother<br />
You are my guiding light<br />
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite<br />
I&#8217;m weak, you&#8217;re bright</p>
<p>Give me your strength, Mother<br />
Give me your care, Mother<br />
You are my guiding light<br />
My shoulder, my shelter, my satellite<br />
I&#8217;m weak, you&#8217;re bright</p>
<p>And once again, Mother<br />
And once again, Mother<br />
Ooh Mother</p>
