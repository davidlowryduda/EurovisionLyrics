<p>Waking in the rubble, walking over glass<br />
Neighbours say we&#8217;re trouble, well that time has passed<br />
Peering from the mirror, no that isn&#8217;t me<br />
Stranger getting nearer, who can this person be?</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t know me at all today<br />
From the fading light I fly</p>
<p>Rise like a phoenix<br />
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance<br />
Retribution, you were warned<br />
Once I&#8217;m transformed, once I&#8217;m reborn</p>
<p>You know I will rise like a phoenix<br />
But you&#8217;re my flame</p>
<p>Go about your business, act as if you&#8217;re free<br />
No one could have witnessed what you did to me</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you wouldn&#8217;t know me today<br />
And you have got to see to believe<br />
From the fading light I fly</p>
<p>Rise like a phoenix<br />
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance<br />
Retribution, you were warned<br />
Once I&#8217;m transformed, once I&#8217;m reborn</p>
<p>I rise up to the sky<br />
You threw me down but I&#8217;m gonna fly</p>
<p>And rise like a phoenix<br />
Out of the ashes seeking rather than vengeance<br />
Retribution, you were warned<br />
Once I&#8217;m transformed, once I&#8217;m reborn</p>
<p>You know I will rise like a phoenix<br />
But you&#8217;re my flame</p>
