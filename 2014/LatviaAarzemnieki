<p>I melted the ice of the polar caps<br />
Found the raiders of the lost ark<br />
Solved a case for the genius from Baker Street<br />
Helped to clean the Central Park</p>
<p>I created the plan for the Chinese wall<br />
Went to desert, made it rain<br />
Swam through a shark tank bloodily<br />
Found Atlantis, by the way<br />
But today</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a cake to bake, I&#8217;ve got no clue at all<br />
I&#8217;ve got a cake to bake and haven&#8217;t done that before<br />
Don&#8217;t be proud, mate please don&#8217;t bother<br />
Go, come on and ask your mother<br />
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake</p>
<p>I talked to a unicorn the other night<br />
Took me up on a lonely star<br />
Did the moonwalk on the milky way<br />
Realised I&#8217;ve gone too far</p>
<p>So I questioned the law of gravity<br />
Put the apple back up to the apple tree<br />
Ej tu nost: I even learned Latvian<br />
I know it&#8217;s so hard to believe<br />
And today</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a cake to bake, I&#8217;ve got no clue at all<br />
I&#8217;ve got a cake to bake and haven&#8217;t done that before<br />
Don&#8217;t be proud, mate please don&#8217;t bother<br />
Go, come on and ask your mother<br />
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a cake to bake and got no clue at all<br />
We&#8217;ve got a cake to bake and haven&#8217;t done that before<br />
Don&#8217;t be proud, mate please don&#8217;t bother<br />
Go, come on and ask your mother<br />
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake</p>
<p>Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, wait for it<br />
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, wait for it<br />
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake, have some cake<br />
Mix some dough, add some love, let it bake</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a cake to bake and got no clue at all<br />
We&#8217;ve got a cake to bake and haven&#8217;t done that before<br />
Don&#8217;t be proud, mate please don&#8217;t bother<br />
Go, come on and ask your mother<br />
How to bake, how to bake, bake that cake</p>
<p>Garšīgi</p>
<p><small>Ej tu nost = fuck off<br />
Garšīgi = delicious</small></p>
