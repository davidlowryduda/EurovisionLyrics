<p>Silent cries every night<br />
This pain don&#8217;t ever leave her life<br />
Daddy&#8217;s home, so she tries to hide<br />
She calls for Mom, but never a reply</p>
<p>She cries, cries, cries, she&#8217;s all alone<br />
Daddy, why, why, why? Leave me alone<br />
She calls for help, she calls for help but no one seems to care<br />
She calls for help but no one seems to care</p>
<p>She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life<br />
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light<br />
I can see the angels standing by your side<br />
It&#8217;ll be alright</p>
<p>She&#8217;s back again, just one more time<br />
Just wants to see her mother smile<br />
She can&#8217;t forget her only child<br />
Mama let the devil in her house</p>
<p>She cries, cries, cries, she&#8217;s all alone<br />
Daddy, why, why, why? Leave me alone<br />
She calls for help, she calls for help but no one seems to care<br />
She calls for help but no one seems to care</p>
<p>She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life<br />
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light<br />
I can see the angels standing by your side<br />
It&#8217;ll be alright</p>
<p>She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life<br />
She keeps on running, running, running, never sees the light<br />
I can see the angels standing by your side<br />
It&#8217;ll be alright</p>
<p>She cries, cries, cries<br />
Daddy, why, why, why?<br />
She keeps on running, running, running from this crazy life<br />
Keeps on running, running, running<br />
Oh it&#8217;ll be alright</p>
