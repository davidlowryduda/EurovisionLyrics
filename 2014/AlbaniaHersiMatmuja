<p>Say no, let go, keep your breath as the anger flows<br />
I know, you know, words can hurt, you&#8217;ll regret them though<br />
So say, say, say, say you&#8217;ll be there when the words are done<br />
Don&#8217;t give in your pride<br />
Keep calm and think twice</p>
<p>Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling<br />
Free your heart and let the peace enlighten your feelings<br />
Sun will rise and the light will be clearing<br />
The tides of the night<br />
Keep calm and think twice </p>
<p>Say no, let go, night will fade and the day will glow<br />
I know, you know that the morning is brighter so<br />
Please say, say, say, say you&#8217;ll be there when the words are done<br />
Donâ€™t give in your pride<br />
Let go and don&#8217;t cry</p>
<p>Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling<br />
Free your heart and let the peace enlighten your feelings<br />
Sun will rise and the light will be clearing<br />
The tides of the night<br />
Keep calm and think twice</p>
<p>(Wait a tick, tiny tick, you&#8217;ll regret it) Just wanna make it right<br />
(Wait a tick, tiny tick, you&#8217;ll forget it) I wanna let it out<br />
(Anything isn&#8217;t it, you want to get it)<br />
Maybe tomorrow will be late to get by</p>
<p>Free your mind from the doubts that are tickling<br />
Free your heart and let the peace enlighten your feelings<br />
Sun will rise and the light will be clearing<br />
The tides of the night<br />
Keep calm and think twice</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t give in your pride) Oh&#8230;<br />
(Keep calm and think twice)<br />
(Don&#8217;t give in your pride) Oh&#8230;<br />
Keep calm and think twice</p>
