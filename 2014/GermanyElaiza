<p>Is it right? Is it right?<br />
Is it right? Is it right?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s got a pen in his hand<br />
A piece of paper staring back<br />
He could run like a man<br />
Another life, back on track</p>
<p>Maybe a drama or a poem<br />
But still he doesn&#8217;t, no<br />
The time is ticking in his ear<br />
The lonely silence disappears</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on<br />
If you say yes or even no<br />
You don&#8217;t know how and where to go</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on<br />
If you say yes or even no<br />
You don&#8217;t know how and where to go</p>
<p>Is it right? Is it right?</p>
<p>She turns over and looks at him<br />
She tries to feel; she can&#8217;t feel anything<br />
But it&#8217;s so hard to say goodbye<br />
When you know that it&#8217;s right</p>
<p>So when it&#8217;s all not what you thought<br />
And the friendship is not enough<br />
When you long to feel alive<br />
And the take the chance to give it up</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on<br />
If you say yes or even no<br />
You don&#8217;t know how and where to go</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on<br />
If you say yes or even no<br />
You don&#8217;t know how and where to go</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s not easy to decide<br />
To find your own direction<br />
Oh the reach is high<br />
But you can&#8217;t hide</p>
<p>Is it right? Is it right?</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on<br />
If you say yes or even no<br />
You don&#8217;t know how and where to go</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on<br />
If you say yes or even no<br />
You don&#8217;t know how and where to go</p>
<p>Is it right or is it wrong?<br />
I can&#8217;t go on, you can&#8217;t go on</p>
