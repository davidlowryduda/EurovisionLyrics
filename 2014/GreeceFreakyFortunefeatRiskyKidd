<p>I feel like rising up to the sky like I&#8217;m a dove<br />
I&#8217;m in love with this feeling, am I down or am I up?<br />
I can&#8217;t frown cause I&#8217;m in luck<br />
I&#8217;ve got the crowd and that&#8217;s enough, I&#8217;m in love</p>
<p>Come on and rise up, rise up to the sky<br />
Come on and rise up, get up and lose your mind<br />
Loose up your feet and fly<br />
Get off the ground tonight</p>
<p>Come on and rise up, jump out of what keeps you down<br />
Get high and rise up, fly, get your feet of the ground<br />
Come on and rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up<br />
Rise, rise, rise, rise, r-r-r-r-rise</p>
<p>I told her rise up, come along and rise up<br />
Music makes me wanna grab somebody rise up</p>
<p>Come on and rise up, dance till the final day<br />
No need to hold back, drink like there&#8217;s no other way<br />
Loose up your feet and fly<br />
Get off the ground tonight</p>
<p>Come on and rise up, jump out of what keeps you down<br />
Get high and rise up, fly, get your feet of the ground<br />
Come on and rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up<br />
Rise, rise, rise, rise, r-r-r-r-rise</p>
<p>I told her rise up, come along and rise up<br />
Music makes me wanna grab somebody rise up<br />
I told her rise up, come along and rise up<br />
Music makes me wanna grab somebody rise up</p>
<p>I&#8217;m down to rise up, pour these shots like &#8220;why stop?&#8221;<br />
I see you shaking, Imma have to smack that, my god<br />
I&#8217;m blowing paper, balling, call me laker<br />
Balling, call me later, balling, call me mason</p>
<p>Hey, our flow is oh so freaky<br />
I roll with it, oh so cheeky<br />
Oh, please girl, no, don&#8217;t tease me<br />
Just got here, I&#8217;m not leaving</p>
<p>Come on and rise up, jump out of what keeps you down<br />
Get high and rise up, fly, get your feet of the ground<br />
Come on and rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up<br />
Rise, rise, rise, rise, r-r-r-r-rise</p>
<p>Rise up<br />
Come on and rise up</p>
<p>I told her rise up, come along and rise up<br />
Music makes me wanna grab somebody rise up</p>
<p>Come on and rise up</p>
