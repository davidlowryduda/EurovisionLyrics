She&#8217;s a star on a dance floor<br />
Beats John Travolta in a rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
At the disco she&#8217;s scoring, and there you see<br />
Them queue up with an eye on her, every time she enters</p>
<p>In the daytime she&#8217;s living a dog&#8217;s life<br />
Practising dressage as a pastime<br />
But when darkness falls, she&#8217;s the one opting out<br />
She demands action, it&#8217;s the same every single day<br />
What can it be that she wants?</p>
<p>Disco tango à la carte<br />
And lots of decorations, flight and speed<br />
A jockey without a horse, who dishes up<br />
With news from USA, soul, reggae or pop</p>
<p>Bach is just as cool in the daytime<br />
Beethoven still takes his slice of the cake<br />
But the night menu is a bit bizarre:<br />
A disco tango à la carte</p>
