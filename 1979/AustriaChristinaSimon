<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Get up, lay down the sleep<br />
In this time of bitter fruits<br />
Friend, be vigilant<br />
To fight against the crying and tears</p>
<p>Look, from the cold high sky<br />
Fall a hundred moons<br />
As a sign for the new beginning<br />
As a sense against the nonsense</p>
<p>And today in Jerusalem<br />
Finally in Jerusalem<br />
Take breath and reflect<br />
And today in Jerusalem<br />
Peace for Jerusalem</p>
<p>Look, from the cold high sky<br />
Fall a hundred moons<br />
As a sign for the new beginning<br />
As a sense against the nonsense</p>
<p>And today in Jerusalem<br />
Finally in Jerusalem<br />
Take breath and reflect<br />
Today in Jerusalem<br />
Peace for Jerusalem<br />
