I love the guitars of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
All the slightly wild songs<br />
From England and America</p>
<p>I love all the old Blues of Harlem<br />
The disco that pulled us away<br />
From the Atlantic</p>
<p>I love the Saturday nights in Paris<br />
In the boulevards at night<br />
Looking at the passing girls</p>
<p>I madly love motorcycles<br />
Being between friends<br />
To play the anger of living<br />
Living</p>
<p>Hey, our life is music<br />
Crazy or romantic<br />
And we&#8217;ve always loved it</p>
<p>Hey, our life is music<br />
Fantastic or nostalgic<br />
It&#8217;s always the most beautiful</p>
<p>I love the untuned pianos<br />
All the trafficed violins<br />
In a studio on the Seine</p>
<p>I love it when a girl loves<br />
The crazy life of the musicians<br />
When she comes to tell me: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
Oh, I love you</p>
<p>Hey, our life is music<br />
Crazy or romantic<br />
And we&#8217;ve always loved it</p>
<p>Hey, our life is music<br />
Fantastic or nostalgic<br />
It&#8217;s always the most beautiful</p>
<p>Hey, our life is music<br />
Crazy or romantic<br />
And we&#8217;ve always loved it</p>
<p>Hey, our life is music<br />
Fantastic or nostalgic<br />
It&#8217;s always the most beautiful<br />
