Walking alone in my town<br />
I felt that a song was coming to me<br />
I approached and I could see<br />
Some children singing</p>
<p>One came and told me: &#8220;Hey, old woman!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to include your weary voice?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see how easy it is to sing&#8221;<br />
&#8220;If your heart is very happy&#8221;</p>
<p>If everybody wanted a song<br />
That speaks of peace, that speaks of love<br />
It would be easy to get us together<br />
To live with an illusion</p>
<p>I want you to feel this song with me<br />
To leave behind your bad mood<br />
So you can step into life with a smile<br />
And enjoy your condition</p>
<p>Sing my song at home alone<br />
You&#8217;ll understand that there&#8217;s no pain<br />
When you have the joy of living<br />
And a heart to share</p>
<p>Close your eyes with me and say goodbye<br />
To that song which taught me<br />
To live today, not yesterday<br />
A song which is of us both is your song</p>
<p>(Lala lalala lalala&#8230;)<br />
Lalalala&#8230; lalalala&#8230;<br />
(Lalalala la lalala lalala&#8230;)<br />
Lalalala&#8230; lalalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Lalalala la lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lalalala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala la lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lalalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Lalalala la&#8230;<br />
