Rise, rise, balloon rise<br />
Rise, rise, balloon rise</p>
<p>I live in a dream, don&#8217;t think bad of me<br />
Isn&#8217;t it better to live life this way?<br />
In the wings of dreams, it&#8217;s good to wonder aimlessly<br />
I don&#8217;t need a visa and I don&#8217;t use a passport</em></small</p>
<p>I have no limits, stopping is not for me<br />
If I listen to my darling, who says: &#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you!&#8221;<br />
Having that certitude is the light of a new day<br />
Go, my golden balloon, wrapped in fantasy</p>
<p>Rise, rise, balloon rise, rise and ask that star<br />
If she will let me live and dream there<br />
I will take my love with me, because I know that I&#8217;ve found<br />
The ideal place for love</p>
<p>Rise, rise, balloon rise, rise and ask that star<br />
If she will let me live and dream there<br />
I will take my love with me, because I know that I&#8217;ve found<br />
The ideal place for love</p>
<p>Rise, rise, balloon rise, rise and ask that star<br />
If she will let me live and dream there<br />
I will take my love with me, because I know that I&#8217;ve found<br />
The ideal place for love</p>
<p>Rise, rise, balloon rise, rise and ask that star<br />
If she will let me live and dream there<br />
I will take my love with me, because I know that I&#8217;ve found<br />
The ideal place for love</p>
<p>Lalala lala lala&#8230; lalala lala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala lala lala&#8230; lalala&#8230;<br />
I will take my love with me, because I know that I&#8217;ve found<br />
The ideal place for love</p>
<p>Rise, rise, balloon rise<br />
