We are the dawdler and company<br />
And this is our melody<br />
We are the dawdler and company<br />
And make dawdler music</p>
<p>We are the dawdler and company<br />
Something like us, the world has never seen before<br />
Our home is nowhere<br />
We are the dawdler and co</p>
<p>In old things that stand everywhere<br />
Sometimes the best ideas are sleeping, whoa&#8230;<br />
We convert them to musical instruments<br />
And so our band was created</p>
<p>First somebody brought the pots<br />
Out of this soon already percussion drums were made, whoa&#8230;<br />
And what is inside of a watering can<br />
Aounds perfectly like a trumpet</p>
<p>We are the dawdler and company<br />
And this is our melody<br />
We are the dawdler and company<br />
And make dawdler music</p>
<p>It was in the garden of our grandma<br />
Where one morning the wonder happened, whoa&#8230;<br />
Since that day we are also playing<br />
On a garden hose</p>
<p>We are the dawdler and company<br />
And this is our melody<br />
We are the dawdler and company<br />
And make dawdler music, whoa..</p>
<p>And make dawdler music<br />
We make dawdler music<br />
