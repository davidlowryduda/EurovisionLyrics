(Do you, do you want the next dance?)<br />
(Do you, do you want the next dance with me?)</p>
<p>Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Dance, now you&#8217;ve got your chance<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine</p>
<p>The discotheque is loud, there is a fog of smoke everywhere<br />
In the crowd I&#8217;m searching for you<br />
Four weeks today since we went separate ways, I guess you&#8217;re happy now<br />
But if you walk by I&#8217;ll say:<br />
(Do you want the next dance?)</p>
<p>Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Dance, now you&#8217;ve got your chance<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine, Oliver&#8230;</p>
<p>Fashionable and in, yes, clothes can make anybody look so right<br />
But now I think the clown is rather sad og folk ser hvem du er?<br />
Ooh&#8230; do you come here, even when your costume is worn out and people can see who you are?<br />
Then you are at my door like before<br />
(Do you want the next dance?)</p>
<p>Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Dance, now you&#8217;ve got your chance<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Give me a dance, dance with me now</p>
<p>Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Dance, take a chance on me<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine</p>
<p>(Dance with me Oliver, Oliver)<br />
Dance, now you&#8217;ve got your chance<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine</p>
<p>(Dance with me Oliver, Oliver)<br />
Dance, now you&#8217;ve got your chance<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Let the next dance, let the next dance be mine</p>
<p>(Dance with me Oliver, Oliver)<br />
Dance, now you&#8217;ve got your chance<br />
Dance with me Oliver, Oliver<br />
Let the next dance, let the next dance&#8230;<br />
