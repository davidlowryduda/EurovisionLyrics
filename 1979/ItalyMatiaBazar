If I sometimes seem to be deceitful, you don&#8217;t know<br />
There&#8217;s a sincere world, which never lies</p>
<p>When a moon beam<br />
Between the sky and the stars acknowledges me<br />
And a gust of wind<br />
Makes time lose its haste</p>
<p>When a moon beam erases<br />
Every shade of doubt and falseness<br />
I&#8217;ll be freer and true, I&#8217;ll fly sincerely to you</p>
<p>You&#8217;re wrong if you think that I don&#8217;t believe in you<br />
If sometimes, it&#8217;s normal, I can see only myself</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s a moon beam<br />
Waiting impatiently each evening because<br />
It takes me back to a temple<br />
Built for love which is only for you</p>
<p>When a moon beam<br />
Can provide thought with its biggest wings<br />
I&#8217;ll be freer and true, I&#8217;ll fly sincerely to you</p>
<p>A moon beam is enough<br />
To transform the sea into some jazz music<br />
And stay on our own, both at home and outside<br />
But always you and I</p>
<p>When a moon beam<br />
Improvises each time a different note for us<br />
It&#8217;ll be our song, evening after evening<br />
It&#8217;ll be our song, evening after evening<br />
