(La lala&#8230; la lala&#8230; la lala&#8230;)</p>
<p>He came from the North and I was a sun child<br />
He said words stronger and softer than the cotton of the sky<br />
He shared the bread and my father gave him a bed:<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;ll begin tomorrow, close to the grey oak&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t dream of him, I didn&#8217;t sleep<br />
Stretched out near the grey oak, I was on the lookout for his step<br />
And an entire burning winter, our love made the earth sing<br />
Like a renewal, like a prayer</p>
<p>He was a snow-man and I was a sun child<br />
Spring on its roundabout unrolled its rainbows for us<br />
If he wanted to leave, I even wouldn&#8217;t have known how to cry<br />
I would have kept the smile that he had given me</p>
<p>When men came, I didn&#8217;t understand<br />
He ran ahead of me, towards the grey oak<br />
But he couldn&#8217;t do anything, the trap was closed on him<br />
They thanked my father, then they left</p>
<p>He returned to the North and I was a sun child<br />
He had his hands outside and on his back the cotton of the sky<br />
He shared the bread and my father gave him a bed<br />
That day seems far away for me, close to the grey oak</p>
<p>Hey, come back, I&#8217;m the sun child<br />
Hey, come back, I&#8217;m the sun child<br />
Sun, sun<br />
