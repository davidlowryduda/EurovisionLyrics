<p>Hallelujah to the world<br />
Hallelujah, everyone will sing<br />
With one single word the heart is filled with much gratitude<br />
And it also pounds: what a wonderful world</p>
<p>Hallelujah with the song<br />
Hallelujah for a day that shines<br />
Hallelujah for all that has been<br />
And all that is yet to come, Hallelujah</p>
<p>Hallelujah to the world<br />
Hallelujah, everyone will sing<br />
And the great bells will echo with many sounds<br />
And with us they will say Hallelujah</p>
<p>Hallelujah with the song<br />
Hallelujah for a day that shines<br />
Hallelujah for all that has been<br />
And all that is yet to come, Hallelujah</p>
<p>Hallelujah for everything<br />
Praise tomorrow and yesterday<br />
Hallelujah and hold each other&#8217;s hands<br />
And sing from one heart, Hallelujah</p>
<p>Hallelujah with the song<br />
Hallelujah for a day that shines<br />
Hallelujah for all that has been<br />
And all that is yet to come, Hallelujah</p>
<p>Hallelujah for all that has been<br />
And all that is yet to come, Hallelujah<br />
