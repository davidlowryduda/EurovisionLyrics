<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
A big boat that moves away<br />
Towards a blue-sky horizon<br />
Streams flowing from the mountain<br />
I&#8217;ve already seen that in your eyes</p>
<p>Blue or stormy skies<br />
We, hand in hand, quietly<br />
Both naked on a beach<br />
I&#8217;ve already seen that in your eyes</p>
<p>In your eyes I see<br />
The reflection of my whole life<br />
My life that goes away<br />
Irresistibly towards a neverending happiness</p>
<p>Oh, how many winters to think<br />
You were going to leave the next day?<br />
But wait a bit for my victory<br />
And I promise you a summer</p>
<p>A very little land corner<br />
Two or three children in the middle<br />
We&#8217;re sitting on a stone bench<br />
I&#8217;ve already seen that in your eyes</p>
<p>A very little land corner<br />
Under a big piece of blue sky<br />
We&#8217;re sitting on a stone bench<br />
And we will both get old</p>
<p>We both, we both<br />
We both, if you want<br />
