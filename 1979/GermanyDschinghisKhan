Hu, ha, hu, ha&#8230; hu, ha, hu, ha&#8230;<br />
Hu, ha, hu, ha&#8230; hu, ha, hu, ha&#8230;<br />
Hu, ha, hu, ha, hu, ha, hu, ha&#8230;</p>
<p>They were riding in competition with the steppe wind<br />
A thousand men &#8211; ha, hu, ha&#8230;<br />
And one was riding in front, they all followed him blindly:<br />
Genghis Khan &#8211; ha, hu, ha&#8230;</p>
<p>The hoofs of their horses, they lashed in the sand<br />
They carried fear and horror in every country<br />
And neither flash nor thunder stopped them<br />
Hu, ha&#8230;</p>
<p>Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always further<br />
Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Come on brothers, drink brothers, fight brothers, on and on</p>
<p>Send for some vodka &#8211; ho, ho, ho, ho&#8230;<br />
Because we are Mongolians &#8211; ha, ha, ha, ha&#8230;<br />
And the devil gets us early enough</p>
<p>Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always further<br />
Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Hey, men; ho, men; dance men, like always</p>
<p>And you hear him laugh &#8211; ho, ho, ho, ho&#8230;<br />
Always laughing louder &#8211; ha, ha, ha, ha&#8230;<br />
And he empties the mug in one go</p>
<p>And each woman, that he liked<br />
He took into his tent &#8211; ha, hu, ha&#8230;<br />
They said, a woman who did not love him<br />
Did not exist anywhere in the world &#8211; ha, hu, ha&#8230;</p>
<p>He fathered seven children in one night<br />
And about his enemies he only laughed<br />
Because nobody could resist his strength<br />
Hu, ha&#8230;</p>
<p>Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always further<br />

Come on brothers, drink brothers, fight brothers, on and on</p>
<p>Send for some vodka &#8211; ho, ho, ho, ho&#8230;<br />
Because we are Mongolians &#8211; ha, ha, ha, ha&#8230;<br />
And the devil gets us early enough</p>
<p>Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Hey, riders; ho, people; hey, riders, always further<br />
Geng&#8230; Geng&#8230; Genghis Khan<br />
Hey, men; ho, men; dance men, like always</p>
<p>And you hear him laugh &#8211; ho, ho, ho, ho&#8230;<br />
Always laughing louder &#8211; ha, ha, ha, ha&#8230;<br />
And he empties the mug in one go<br />
Ha&#8230; hu, ha, hu&#8230;<br />
