You&#8217;ve been standing at the horizon<br />
You&#8217;ve been watching the sea wondering if earth is round<br />
But all you saw was a boat disappearing<br />
In the rolling mist</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not afraid of flying<br />
Because above the clouds heaven&#8217;s door is ajar<br />
Like earth and moon, we&#8217;re attracted to each other<br />
Please hold me as tight as you can<br />
I feel like a&#8230;</p>
<p>Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, high up in the sky<br />
Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, now I understand<br />
Oh&#8230; how small the world is (High in the sky)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been wandering all over the world<br />
Our freedom has been carried as a burden<br />
And the sun has warmed us, but when it sets<br />
I need the warmth from you<br />
Oh&#8230; I feel like a&#8230;</p>
<p>Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, high up in the sky<br />
Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, now I understand<br />
Oh&#8230; how small the world is</p>
<p>Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, high up in the sky<br />
Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, now I understand<br />
Oh&#8230; how small the world is (High in the sky)</p>
<p>Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, high up in the sky<br />
Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, now I understand</p>
<p>Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, high up in the sky<br />
Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, now I understand</p>
<p>Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, high up in the sky<br />
Satellite, satellite, oh&#8230;<br />
Like a satellite, now<br />
