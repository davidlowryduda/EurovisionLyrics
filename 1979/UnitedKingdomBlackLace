<p>Out on a late night, way after midnight<br />
Armed with a bottle or two<br />
What&#8217;s the time? I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; out of my mind<br />
I&#8217;ve gotta get to you</p>
<p>She was in black lace, come back to my place<br />
Come for a drink and a dance<br />
Boy, I found she didn&#8217;t hang around<br />
I didn&#8217;t stand a chance</p>
<p>She paid a big rent<br />
For an apartment uptown One-twenty-one<br />
She said: come inside, I&#8217;ve got nothin&#8217; to hide<br />
I only want some fun</p>
<p>Havin&#8217; a good time, walkin&#8217; a tight line<br />
I was out of my head<br />
Just when I reached for you, like I usually do<br />
I found her instead</p>
<p>Mary Ann, I&#8217;m gonna do what I can<br />
But I can&#8217;t do more than try<br />
Tearin&#8217; my heart out tryin&#8217; to make it up to you</p>
<p>Mary Ann, I&#8217;m gonna do what I can<br />
That&#8217;s truth, and that&#8217;s no lie<br />
Cryin&#8217; my eyes out, gotta get it back with you</p>
<p>I woke up early with everythin&#8217; blurry<br />
And my head rattled with pain<br />
Even so, I heard the doorbell go<br />
And someone call my name</p>
<p>There was her best friend, down for the weekend<br />
I knew I&#8217;d met her before<br />
She said: you dirty man, when I see Mary Ann<br />
I&#8217;m gonna tell her the score</p>
<p>Mary Ann, I&#8217;m gonna do what I can<br />
But I can&#8217;t do more than try<br />
Tearin&#8217; my heart out tryin&#8217; to make it up to you</p>
<p>Mary Ann, I&#8217;m gonna do what I can<br />
That&#8217;s truth, and that&#8217;s no lie<br />
Cryin&#8217; my eyes out, gotta get it back with you</p>
<p>Out on a late night, way after midnight<br />
Armed with a bottle or two<br />
What&#8217;s the time? I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; out of my mind<br />
I&#8217;ve gotta get to you</p>
<p>Mary Ann, I&#8217;m gonna do what I can<br />
But I can&#8217;t do more than try<br />
Tearin&#8217; my heart out tryin&#8217; to make it up to you</p>
<p>Mary Ann, I&#8217;m gonna do what I can<br />
That&#8217;s truth, and that&#8217;s no lie<br />

<p>Cryin&#8217; my eyes out, gotta get it back with you</p>
