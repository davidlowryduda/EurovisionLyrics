God, God, God, they never call you that<br />
Candles, candles, candles, they never light them for you<br />
But your words, words, they burn<br />
And still, still, still, they are quoted<br />
Socrates, you superstar</p>
<p>Pure and good, the first Christ<br />
Socrates, you superstar<br />
You went round in a beggar&#8217;s clothing<br />
And there were birds in your white beard</p>
<p>The crowd around you â€“ you were a holy light<br />
Socrates, you superstar<br />
You talked to them about love and light<br />
The wisest man, the king of wisdom</p>
<p>God, God, God, they never call you that<br />
Candles, candles, candles, they never light them for you<br />
But your words, words, they burn<br />
And still, still, still, they are quoted<br />
Socrates, you superstar</p>
<p>God, God, God, they never call you that<br />
Candles, candles, candles, they never light them for you<br />
But your words, words, they burn<br />
And still, still, still, they are quoted<br />
Socrates, you superstar, superstar, superstar</p>
<p>Pilate supporters took the light from you<br />
Socrates, you superstar<br />
And Athens, that you loved so much<br />
Gave you a bitter poison</p>
<p>The break of day was bitter, the earth was orphaned<br />
Socrates, you superstar<br />
Your time had come<br />
You found the eternal God</p>
<p>God, God, God, they never call you that<br />
Candles, candles, candles, they never light them for you<br />
But your words, words, they burn<br />
And still, still, still, they are quoted<br />
Socrates, you superstar</p>
<p>God, God, God, they never call you that<br />
Candles, candles, candles, they never light them for you<br />
But your words, words, they burn<br />
And still, still, still, they are quoted<br />
Socrates, you superstar, superstar, superstar<br />
