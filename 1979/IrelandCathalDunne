<p>It seemed life had no answers for me<br />
No special meaning or plan<br />
How could I be a happy man?</p>
<p>Then just like in a love song<br />
You&#8217;re here, making each day seem so clear<br />
Now I can smile – I&#8217;m a happy man</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love and I&#8217;m alive – happy man<br />
Got the sun inside – happy man<br />
I&#8217;ve got a girl on my mind<br />
Love in my heart – happy man</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love and I&#8217;m alive – happy man<br />
Got the sun inside – happy man<br />
So now the whole world can see<br />
I&#8217;ve got all I need – I&#8217;m a happy man</p>
<p>And now you say it&#8217;s happened to you<br />
This love I&#8217;m feeling inside<br />
Girl, you&#8217;ve made me a happy man</p>
<p>And I will share a lifetime with you<br />
Making our dreams all come true<br />
Now I can smile – I&#8217;m a happy man</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love and I&#8217;m alive – happy man<br />
Got the sun inside – happy man<br />
I&#8217;ve got a girl on my mind<br />
Love in my heart – happy man</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love and I&#8217;m alive – happy man<br />
Got the sun inside – happy man<br />
So now the whole world can see<br />
I&#8217;ve got all I need – I&#8217;m a happy man</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love and I&#8217;m alive – happy man<br />
Got the sun inside – happy man<br />
I&#8217;ve got a girl on my mind<br />
Love in my heart – happy man</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love and I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
