The child of the earth is looking for love<br />
Will she ever settle down<br />
Even a migrating bird<br />
Finds a nesting tree instinctively</p>
<p>But the child of the earth keeps looking for love<br />
Sadness in her mind<br />
I don&#8217;t have any wings, but I must keep moving on<br />
Will I ever find peace?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at the blue sky, the brightest star<br />
I&#8217;m begging you, to lead me home</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at the blue sky, the brightest star<br />
I&#8217;m begging you, to lead me home<br />
Lead me</p>
<p>The child of the earth is looking for love<br />
Trying to hide her longing<br />
All my wishes of the dawning<br />
Will be destroyed by the sunset</p>
<p>The child of the earth is looking for love<br />
Star of the night you are my consolation<br />
As long as your shine<br />
Is lighting up my way</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at the blue sky, the brightest star<br />
I&#8217;m begging you, to lead me home<br />
I&#8217;m looking at the blue sky, the brightest star<br />
I&#8217;m begging you, to lead me home</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m looking at the blue sky, the brightest star)<br />
I&#8217;m begging you, to lead me home<br />
