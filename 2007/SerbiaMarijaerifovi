I can&#8217;t close my eyes<br />
The empty bed chases sleep away<br />
And my life is melting away<br />
And disappearing quickly, in a split second</p>
<p>It seems I&#8217;m losing my mind<br />
As I don&#8217;t even notice reality<br />
I still love you<br />
I still trust you blindly</p>
<p>Like crazy, I don&#8217;t know where to go<br />
I&#8217;m afraid of a new love<br />
And the days are like open wounds<br />
I don&#8217;t count them any more</p>
<p>Prayer, like ardour on my lips<br />
Prayer, just your name, instead of words</p>
<p>Heaven knows, just as I do<br />
How many times I&#8217;ve repeated this<br />
Heaven knows, just as I do<br />
That your name is my only prayer</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t lie to God<br />
As long as I pray<br />
And I&#8217;d be lying if I said<br />
That I don&#8217;t love you</p>
<p>Prayer, like ardour on my lips<br />
Prayer, just your name, instead of words</p>
<p>Heaven knows, just as I do<br />
How many times I&#8217;ve repeated this<br />
Heaven knows, just as I do<br />
That your name is my prayer&#8230;<br />
(Prayer, prayer)</p>
<p>And heaven knows, just as I do<br />
How many times I&#8217;ve repeated this<br />
Heaven knows, just as I do<br />
That your name is my only prayer</p>
<p>That your name is my prayer<br />
