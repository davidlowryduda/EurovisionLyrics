She blew off the grass and started to play<br />
That little lady from the suburbs<br />
Who can read from people&#8217;s palms</p>
<p>There the cats are hungry in the morning<br />
After a night so full of unease<br />
She will stroke and feed them</p>
<p>At night she strays, and sleeps by day<br />
And her eyes know more than mine<br />
I ran out of words, I just stood there<br />
I would die with her alone</p>
<p>I would die with her in one day<br />
And if that&#8217;s not enough for you<br />
If there were a hundred women there<br />
I&#8217;d offer her a dance I can&#8217;t dance myself</p>
<p>Behind the railway is her nest<br />
She collects coins from fountains<br />
And then she puts them on the tracks</p>
<p>She&#8217;s building herself a temple, a bridge made of tin<br />
Already being crossed by the first passenger<br />
So that his legs won&#8217;t hurt</p>
<p>She&#8217;s been through hell and she knows the spells<br />
She collects the trodden coins<br />
And whoever sees her is damned<br />
I would die with her alone</p>
<p>I would die with her in one day<br />
And if that&#8217;s not enough for you<br />
If there were a hundred women there<br />
I&#8217;d offer her a dance I can&#8217;t dance myself</p>
<p>I will remember that instant<br />
When she played, it sounded like Paganini<br />
And I already knew I was damned<br />
I asked how much, feeling guilty</p>
<p>I would die with her in one day<br />
And if that&#8217;s not enough for you<br />
If there were a hundred women there<br />
I&#8217;d offer her a dance I can&#8217;t dance myself</p>
<p>I would die with her in one day<br />
And if that&#8217;s not enough for you<br />
If there were a hundred women there<br />
I&#8217;d offer her a dance I can&#8217;t dance myself<br />
