<p>How many times have you fooled me and denied that<br />
It&#8217;s her who you love, and it sure isn&#8217;t me?<br />
So now that it&#8217;s over, I&#8217;ll try and take it sober<br />
Leave questions unasked, remember us laughing at the broken past<br />
God, if I could make it on without you</p>
<p>You&#8217;re such a casual man, oh, wavin&#8217; an empty hand<br />
I&#8217;m helpless and I&#8217;m lonely without you<br />
Yes, you&#8217;re a casual man, lendin&#8217; an empty hand<br />
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose</p>
<p>I used to dream we&#8217;d take it nice and easy<br />
Get jobs, settle down in Jameson Town<br />
If now you could see me, you&#8217;d think twice about leaving<br />
You said forever is the time you gonna spend around</p>
<p>So why did you leave me?<br />
And why should I believe it? &#8211; You say goodbye<br />
Oh, why, oh&#8230; why you leave me?<br />
Said, why?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re such a casual man, oh, wavin&#8217; an empty hand<br />
I&#8217;m helpless and I&#8217;m lonely without you<br />
You&#8217;re such a casual man, lendin&#8217; an empty hand<br />
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose</p>
<p>Casual man, lendin&#8217; an empty hand<br />
Left me breathless with nothing more to lose<br />
Except an evanescent unsubstantial blues</p>
