<p>I have to leave, but you are still sleeping<br />
There&#8217;s nothing to say, our time has run out<br />
You took me to bed, that&#8217;s what you were seeking<br />
But you don&#8217;t even care what I am about</p>
<p>I wanna, I wanna wake you</p>
<p>Leave me alone, I wanna go home<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna see you, so leave me alone<br />
Leave me alone, &#8217;cause I feel like dyin&#8217;</p>
<p>Leave me alone, I wanna go home<br />
The day will still come when I see you crying<br />
&#8216;Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone</p>
<p>But what if I stay and wait till she comes home?<br />
She don&#8217;t even know she loves you in vain<br />
The lies that you told will turn into sorrow<br />
I gotta go crazy just to stay sane</p>
<p>I wanna, I wanna break you</p>
<p>Leave me alone, I wanna go home<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna see you, so leave me alone<br />
Leave me alone, &#8217;cause I feel like dyin&#8217;</p>
<p>Leave me alone, I wanna go home<br />
The day will still come when I see you crying<br />
&#8216;Cause you will get yours, just leave me alone</p>
<p>I gotta, I gotta hate you</p>
<p>Leave me alone, I wanna go home<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna see you, so leave me alone<br />
Leave me alone, &#8217;cause I feel like dyin&#8217;</p>
<p>Leave me alone, I wanna go home<br />
I couldn&#8217;t care less if love just lies dying<br />
And this is goodbye, just leave me alone</p>
