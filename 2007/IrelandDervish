<p>The curtain has been raised, the wall no longer stands<br />
And from Lisadell to Latvia we&#8217;re singing as one clan<br />
The curtain has been raised and Europe&#8217;s all one stage<br />
And the archipelagic icicles have melted like the cage</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need no party, just a party band<br />
A continental choir singing hand in hand</p>
<p>They might scare the blackbird but they cannot stop him sing<br />
They may steal the honey but they&#8217;ll never steal the sting<br />
They may crush the flowers, trample every living thing<br />
But they can&#8217;t stop the spring</p>
<p>They might scare the blackbird but they cannot stop him sing<br />
They may steal the honey but they&#8217;ll never steal the sting<br />
They may crush the flowers and trample every living thing<br />
But they can&#8217;t stop the spring</p>
<p>They might scare the blackbird but they cannot stop him sing<br />
They may steal the honey but they&#8217;ll never steal the sting<br />
They may crush the flowers and trample every living thing<br />
But they can&#8217;t stop the spring</p>
<p>No, they can&#8217;t stop the spring</p>
