<p>Stars in the sky<br />
When the shadows fall, when the sunlight dies<br />
Empty streets are filled with the pale lamplight<br />
We are just two lonely shades walking in the night</p>
<p>Words lose their sense<br />
When I feel you near, when I touch your hands<br />
I&#8217;m trying not to think that at break of dawn<br />
You&#8217;ll be gone and I&#8217;ll be lost, numb and all alone</p>
<p>When the morning comes, I&#8217;m all alone<br />
Left to live another day, in joy or sadness, on my own<br />
When the morning comes, I&#8217;m all alone<br />
Every time at break of dawn</p>
<p>Weak and unwise<br />
I betray all fears that I should disguise<br />
Melting in your arms, I fail to realise<br />
Why the mornings always change the colour of your eyes</p>
<p>When the morning comes, I&#8217;m all alone<br />
Every time at break of dawn</p>
<p>Love or leave, I&#8217;m with and without you<br />
How come I am up to this senseless game?<br />
How could I stop thinking about you?<br />
Love or leave, don&#8217;t play with my heart again</p>
<p>Love or leave, I&#8217;m with and without you<br />
How come I am up to this senseless game?<br />
How could I stop thinking about you?<br />
Hey&#8230; love or leave, don&#8217;t play with my heart again</p>
