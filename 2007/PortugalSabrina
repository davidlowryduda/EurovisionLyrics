<p>Come dance with me in the waves of adventure<br />
I promise I will give you oceans of tenderness<br />
The wind told me that you will always be my lover<br />
Even the sky knows that you are the one I want to love, to love</p>
<p>Dance with me, I give you the sky that is in me<br />
Dance with me, to all your wishes I will say yes<br />
Dance with me, in your arms I will dream<br />
Dance with me, I give you the moon, the sun and the sea</p>
<p>Dance this song because it&#8217;s all about you<br />
It has rhythm and joy, that is what you give to me<br />
In the melody there&#8217;s a light, a reason<br />
In the harmony there&#8217;s a strength that is passion, passion</p>
<p>Dance with me, I give you the sky that is in me<br />
Dance with me, to all your wishes I will say yes<br />
Dance with me, in your arms I will dream<br />
Dance with me, I give you the moon, the sun and the sea</p>
<p>Dance with me, I&#8217;m happy in your arms<br />
I love you so much, you&#8217;re my dream, my darling<br />
<em>Let&#8217;s dance together, I wanna take you to the moon</em><br />
<em>Let&#8217;s dance together, I wanna make your dreams come true</em></p>
<p>Dance with me, I give you the sky that is in me<br />
Dance with me, to all your wishes I will say yes<br />
Dance with me, in your arms I will dream<br />
Dance with me, I give you the moon, the sun and the sea</p>
<p>Dance with me<br />
