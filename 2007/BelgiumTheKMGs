<p>Can you feel the love power?<br />
Can you feel the love?</p>
<p>I wake up every morning<br />
Another day on my own<br />
I&#8217;m in the eye of the storm<br />
And I feel so alone</p>
<p>But when I notice the sunshine (Sunshine)<br />
The summer breeze in the air<br />
And when I dream of your sweet smile<br />
Why should I fall into despair?</p>
<p>Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
Can you feel the love power all day?<br />
Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
(Can you feel the love power?)</p>
<p>Today is another bad day<br />
I&#8217;m gonna turn into stone<br />
There&#8217;s too much pressure on me<br />
And I feel so alone</p>
<p>I feel the temperature rising (Rising)<br />
There&#8217;s something new in the air<br />
And all the birds are just singing love<br />
Why should I fall into despair?</p>
<p>Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
Can you feel the love power all day?<br />
Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
(Can you feel the love power?)</p>
<p>(Can&#8217;t you feel the love power?)<br />
(Can&#8217;t you feel the love power?)<br />
(Can&#8217;t you feel the love power?)<br />
Can you feel the love?<br />
(Can&#8217;t you feel the love power?)</p>
<p>(Can you feel the love power coming your way?)<br />
(Can you feel the love power?)</p>
<p>Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
Can you feel the love power all day?<br />
Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
Can you feel the love power?</p>
<p>One more time, come on (Coming your way)<br />
Can you feel the love power coming your way?<br />
Can you feel the love power?</p>
<p>Can you feel the love power?</p>
