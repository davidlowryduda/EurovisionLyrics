No, it&#8217;s not the pain of needing you<br />
I live, and I know I don&#8217;t have you<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You&#8217;ll never know how much I love you<br />
You&#8217;ll never know how much I need you</em></font></p>
<p>If you look into my eyes<br />
That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve been hiding pain for a long time now<br />
And that line from my song:<br />
You are like salt on my wound</p>
<p>For I believe in love<br />
Something you didn&#8217;t want<br />
And this heart can only dream of<br />
And I won&#8217;t let it wake up</p>
<p>For I believe in love<br />
Something you didn&#8217;t want<br />
And this heart can only dream of<br />
And I won&#8217;t let it wake up</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You&#8217;ll never know how much I love you<br />
You&#8217;ll never know how much I need you</em></font></p>
<p>If you look into my heart<br />
That&#8217;s where you live eternally<br />
For me, the world without you<br />
Might as well not exist</p>
<p>For I believe in love<br />
Just as you do<br />
And all this heart can do is dream<br />
And I won&#8217;t let it wake up</p>
<p>For I believe in love<br />
Just as you do (As you do)<br />
And all this heart can do is dream<br />
And I won&#8217;t let it wake up</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not the pain of needing you<br />
I live, and I know I don&#8217;t have you<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You&#8217;ll never know how much I love you<br />
You&#8217;ll never know how much I need you</em></font></p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not the pain<br />
