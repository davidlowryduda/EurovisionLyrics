<p>I&#8217;ll let the music play while love lies softly bleeding<br />
In heavy hands on shadowlands<br />
As thunderclouds roll in, sunset is receding<br />
No summer wine, no Valentine</p>
<p>A tiger trapped inside a cage<br />
An actor on an empty stage<br />
Come see the show<br />
Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll can heal your soul<br />
When broken hearts lose all control</p>
<p>Some rivers still run dry and jungles burn to embers<br />
Gold autumn days must fade to grey<br />
There is a reason why a haunted man remembers<br />
One frozen night, his darkest day</p>
<p>A tiger trapped inside a cage<br />
An actor on an empty stage<br />
Come see the show<br />
Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll will heal your soul<br />
When broken hearts lose all control</p>
<p>A passion killed by acid rain<br />
A rollercoaster in my brain<br />
But how would you know?<br />
In your satin, silk and lace<br />
Another time, another place</p>
<p>A tiger trapped inside a cage<br />
An actor on an empty stage<br />
Come see the show<br />
Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll will heal your soul<br />
When broken hearts lose all control</p>
<p>A love let loose and painted black<br />
A train stuck on a broken track<br />
Well, I&#8217;ll let it go<br />
Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll has healed my soul<br />
The stage is set, on with the show</p>
