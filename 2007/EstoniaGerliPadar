<p>We&#8217;re standing in the rain<br />
And sipping cold champagne<br />
The night is full of angels of sin<br />
The demons of pleasure and pain</p>
<p>You whisper in my ear<br />
I&#8217;m holding back the tears<br />
Your words are burning the way to my heart<br />
That&#8217;s been held hostage for years</p>
<p>The wild look in your eyes<br />
Will light my fire inside<br />
This is the night that we cannot deny<br />
We&#8217;ll always be partners in crime</p>
<p>I kiss your lips so sweet<br />
Mmm but do you feel the heat?<br />
Is it so wrong to be hungry for love?<br />
To follow the passion so deep?</p>
<p>The wild look in your eyes<br />
Will light my fire inside<br />
This is the night that we cannot deny<br />
We&#8217;ll always be partners in crime</p>
<p>The wild look in your eyes<br />
Will light my fire inside<br />
This is the night that we cannot deny<br />
We&#8217;ll always be partners in crime</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s too late to turn back the time<br />
We just have to go with the flow<br />
I will be yours and you will be mine<br />
And that&#8217;s how the story goes</p>
<p>The wild look in your eyes<br />
Will light my fire inside<br />
This is the night that we cannot deny<br />
We&#8217;ll always be partners in crime</p>
<p>The wild look in your eyes<br />
Will light my fire inside<br />
This is the night that we cannot deny<br />
We&#8217;ll always be partners in crime</p>
<p>Partners in crime<br />
Partners in crime</p>
