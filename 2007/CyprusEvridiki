Every Monday, you finish<br />
Work too late and then<br />
TV and sleep<br />
Just as my heart wakes up</p>
<p>And every Tuesday, you tell me<br />
In the morning &#8211; and you forget it<br />
&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to the movies&#8221;<br />
And in the evening &#8211; &#8220;sorry&#8221;</p>
<p>Like this, like that, life passes by<br />
And the good times pass us over<br />
Like this, like that, love breaks<br />
Routine and laziness threaten us</p>
<p>Like this, like that, I can&#8217;t take it anymore<br />
I&#8217;m disappointed, you&#8217;ve lost me<br />
I&#8217;m not sticking around, like this, like that<br />
That&#8217;s the end, like this, like that</p>
<p>Even on Saturday at midnight<br />
You already tell me good night<br />
You fall asleep just as I go out<br />
Singing to yourself very loudly:</p>
<p>Like this, like that, life passes by<br />
And the good times pass us over<br />
Like this, like that, love breaks<br />
Routine and laziness threaten us</p>
<p>Like this, like that, I can&#8217;t take it anymore<br />
I&#8217;m disappointed, you&#8217;ve lost me<br />
I&#8217;m not sticking around, like this, like that<br />
That&#8217;s the end, like this, like that</p>
<p>Like this, like that, life passes by<br />
And the good times pass us over<br />
Like this, like that, love breaks<br />
Routine and laziness threaten us</p>
<p>Like this, like that, I can&#8217;t take it anymore<br />
I&#8217;m disappointed, you&#8217;ve lost me<br />
I&#8217;m not sticking around, like this, like that<br />
That&#8217;s the end, like this, like that</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sticking around, like this, like that<br />
Here&#8217;s the end, like this, like that<br />
I&#8217;m not sticking around, like this, like that<br />
That&#8217;s the end<br />
