(Hey, hey, hey)<br />
(Hey, hey, hey)</p>
<p>Come to me, discover love<br />
Come to me, feel my passion<br />
You, come to me like the scorpion<br />
That sweetens with its wound</p>
<p>There are kisses from me that nobody&#8217;s stolen<br />
There are verses in me that nobody&#8217;s heard<br />
You, come to me like the heart<br />
That would get stuck in me</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ever look back<br />
Dare to give your heart</p>
<p><em>I love you</em>, my darling (Hee-eh-oh)<br />
Tear my life and break it in two<br />
Let my days break down if everything is a lie<br />
And I lose your love, <em>the power of love</em></p>
<p><em>I love you</em>, my darling (Hee-eh-oh)<br />
Seduce my life, feel the passion<br />
Come, give me your days and dance to my sound<br />
<em>Come give your love, come give me your love</em></p>
<p>(Hey, hey, hey)</p>
<p>Come to me without fear of pain<br />
Feel for me the same way I do<br />
You, come to me like the scorpion<br />
That kills with its wound</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ever look back<br />
Dare to give your heart</p>
<p><em>I love you</em>, my darling (Hee-eh-oh)<br />
Tear my life and break it in two<br />
Let my days break down if everything is a lie<br />
And I lose your love, <em>the power of love</em></p>
<p><em>I love you</em>, my darling (Hee-eh-oh)<br />
Seduce my life, feel the passion<br />
Come, give me your days and dance to my sound<br />
<em>Come give your love, come give me your love</em></p>
<p>(Hey, hey, hey) <em>I love you</em>, my darling<br />
(Hey, hey, hey) My dance of love</p>
<p><em>I love you</em>, my darling (Hee-eh-oh)<br />
Tear my life and break it in two<br />
Let my days break down if everything is a lie<br />
And I lose your love, <em>the power of love</em></p>
<p><em>I love you</em>, my darling (Hee-eh-oh)<br />
Seduce my life, feel the passion<br />
Come, give me your days and dance to my sound<br />
<em>Come give your love, come give me your love</em></p>
<p>(Hey)<br />
