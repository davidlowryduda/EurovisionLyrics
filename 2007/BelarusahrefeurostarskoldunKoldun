<p>Welcome to the night and you will see<br />
You&#8217;ve got the magic power<br />
I am on my way, I keep the key to your tower</p>
<p>You can serve me something really hot<br />
Call it love or madness<br />
But you&#8217;ll get the best of what I&#8217;ve got</p>
<p>Work your magic, I never wanna lose this feeling<br />
I am able and I&#8217;m willing, yes, I&#8217;m willing<br />
Work your magic, you set my beating heart in motion<br />
When you cast your loving potion, loving potion</p>
<p>Work your magic, I never wanna lose this feeling<br />
I am able and I&#8217;m willing, yes, I&#8217;m willing<br />
Work your magic, you set my beating heart in motion<br />
When you cast your loving potion over me</p>
<p>Baby, you can put your spell on me<br />
Makin&#8217; it slow and steady<br />
Maybe I can solve your mystery, are you ready?</p>
<p>We are standing closely skin to skin<br />
Playin&#8217; a very old game<br />
In this game of love, you always win</p>
<p>Work your magic, I never wanna lose this feeling<br />
I am able and I&#8217;m willing, yes, I&#8217;m willing<br />
Work your magic, you set my beating heart in motion<br />
When you cast your loving potion over me</p>
<p>When you cast your loving potion over me</p>
<p>So you work your magic<br />
Baby, work your magic<br />
Keep my heart forever bound</p>
<p>Work your magic, I never wanna lose this feeling<br />
I am able and I&#8217;m willing, yes, I&#8217;m willing<br />
Work your magic, you set my beating heart in motion<br />
When you cast your loving potion over me</p>
