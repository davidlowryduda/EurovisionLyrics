It&#8217;s the sweet smile of the girl who enchants me<br />
And makes my heart tremble<br />
It&#8217;s the sea in your green eyes that calls me<br />
And makes me feel love</p>
<p>When it seems dark, you make me see the sun<br />
I want to stay here with you<br />
Live for you, only for you</p>
<p>This night will be the immensity<br />
The love between us will never end again<br />
Now and then, and forever more<br />
This night will be forever</p>
<p>The perfume of your skin invites me<br />
To discover what I don&#8217;t know<br />
Between all the stars, you make me look at the moon<br />
And make me sing love</p>
<p>When I lose hope, you give me your hand<br />
I want to stay here with you<br />
Live for you, only for you</p>
<p>This night will be the immensity<br />
The love between us will never end again<br />
Now and then, and forever more<br />
For the reason that only you know<br />
Only you know</p>
<p>This night will be the immensity<br />
The love between us will never end again<br />
Now and then, and forever more<br />
This night will be forever<br />
This night will be forever<br />
