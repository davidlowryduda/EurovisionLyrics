<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Down a river without a name, like a wave<br />
May my pain begin its journey to find you<br />
Rose of all winds<br />
Only I know the paths over water</p>
<p>Day by day and night by night<br />
I build my pain<br />
Like a bridge on a river, after you<br />
Who still loves you like I do<br />
Knows your soul, just the way I do?</p>
<p>Unfaithful sorrow, my pain<br />
How do I return you?<br />
To embrace you, like it&#8217;s the first time<br />
Cover with gold rivers of tears for you</p>
<p>Unfaithful sorrow, eh, if I only could<br />
I would still go anywhere with you<br />
May this pain bind to my soul for dying for you</p>
<p>Unfaithful sorrow, my pain<br />
How do I return you?<br />
To embrace you, like it&#8217;s the first time<br />
Cover with gold rivers of tears for you</p>
<p>Unfaithful sorrow (My pain)<br />
I would still go anywhere with you<br />
May this pain bind to my soul for dying for you<br />
(Unfaithful sorrow, unfaithful sorrow)<br />
