<p>Livin&#8217; in this world &#8211; be a little too much<br />
Don&#8217;t let it get you down, get up and strut<br />
Ooh&#8230; if you ever get the chance, hold your hand out and take it<br />
Make a promise to yourself, don&#8217;t you break it</p>
<p>Oh, I tried to get up when I was upside down<br />
Got to find a way to turn my life around</p>
<p>This is the time for us to get a life<br />
Open your mind to a better life<br />
There&#8217;s no way of knowin&#8217; where you&#8217;re goin&#8217;<br />
Get a life, a better life</p>
<p>Go outta your way and make some compromise<br />
Hold to your dreams and you will realise<br />
If you don&#8217;t understand it, don&#8217;t take it for granted<br />
Open your mind to a better life</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s turn up the heat, start a ripple in the water<br />
Wake the soul from its sleep, no particular order<br />
Could be wastin&#8217; precious time, free the mind, are you willin&#8217;?<br />
Don&#8217;t be afraid, do your dance and start livin&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a vision in mind, I&#8217;m doin&#8217; my time<br />
I&#8217;m livin&#8217; my life &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve opened my mind</p>
<p>This is the time for us to get a life<br />
Open your mind to a better life<br />
There&#8217;s no way of knowin&#8217; where you&#8217;re goin&#8217;<br />
