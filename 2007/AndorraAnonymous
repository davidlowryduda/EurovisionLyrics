I can&#8217;t understand why the world is upside down<br />
And we don&#8217;t want to find solutions to the problems<br />
Don&#8217;t want to be what you are not</p>
<p>You&#8217;re always thinking whether your life is good<br />
And there&#8217;s no time for the rest<br />
The world is in danger and you don&#8217;t do anything</p>
<p>We all agree we can do it<br />
We can unite, do it well<br />
Think by yourself, by yourself</p>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Left, right, up and down, turned upside down<br />
That&#8217;s how we treat the world right now<br />
Can&#8217;t hide the fact that it&#8217;s happening</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We can do our world some good<br />
We can make a change, that&#8217;s what we should<br />
Time will tell us, but we must act now</em></font></p>
<p>The problem seems to be<br />
That the interests are not the same<br />
Fixing the world now<br />
It&#8217;s possible (if we all do it)</p>
<p>We all agree we can do it<br />
We can unite, do it well<br />
Think by yourself, by yourself</p>

<p>If you want, you can do it, we can change it<br />
Transform reality<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We still can act, but we don&#8217;t react<br />
&#8216;Cause we only care about what we have<br />
About what we have</em></font></p>
