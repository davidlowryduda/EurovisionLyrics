<p>Mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Moves &#8211; I like to make &#8216;em, grooves &#8211; I like to shake &#8216;em<br />
Shake &#8216;em from my troublesome mind<br />
&#8216;Cause sometimes you&#8217;ll find that I&#8217;m out of my mind<br />
You see, baby, I&#8217;m the worrying kind</p>
<p>Words &#8211; I like to break &#8216;em, words &#8211; I like to shake &#8216;em<br />
Shake &#8216;em from my troublesome mind<br />
And you turn up your nose &#8211; it&#8217;s a joke, you suppose<br />
But baby, I&#8217;m the worrying kind</p>
<p>So if you see me somewhere with that glassy old stare<br />
And the panic and fear in my eyes<br />
Don&#8217;t call for first aid or the fire brigade<br />
Or the local police, &#8217;cause they won&#8217;t care</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just a silly old boy with my head in the can<br />
Just a mortal with potential of a superman<br />
But what sense does it make when I feel like a fake<br />
When I&#8217;m saying to you all: be good for goodness sake?<br />
Yoohoo&#8230; aha ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Words &#8211; I like to break &#8216;em, words &#8211; I like to shake &#8216;em<br />
Shake &#8216;em from my troublesome mind<br />
And why? &#8211; Heaven knows, it&#8217;s a joke, I suppose<br />
But baby, I&#8217;m the worrying kind<br />
Yeah</p>
<p>So if you see me somewhere with that glassy old stare<br />
And the panic and fear in my eyes<br />
Don&#8217;t call for first aid or the fire brigade<br />
Or the local police, &#8217;cause they won&#8217;t care</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just a silly old boy with my head in the can<br />
Just a mortal with potential of a superman<br />
But what sense does it make when I feel like a fake<br />
When I&#8217;m saying to you all: be good for goodness sake?<br />
Yoohoo&#8230; aha ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh, words &#8211; I like to break &#8216;em, words &#8211; I like to shake &#8216;em<br />
Shake &#8216;em from my troublesome mind<br />
And why? &#8211; Heaven knows, it&#8217;s a joke, I suppose<br />
But baby, I&#8217;m the worrying kind</p>
<p>And you turn up your nose and you say it&#8217;s a pose<br />
But baby, I&#8217;m the worrying kind<br />
Yeah, sometimes I&#8217;m blind, I&#8217;m just out of my mind<br />
Baby, I&#8217;m the worrying kind</p>
<p>Oh yeah<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; oh yeah</p>
