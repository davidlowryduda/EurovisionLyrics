<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to let you go<br />
And I thought I was strong<br />
But your love&#8217;s got a hold on me<br />
And now I can&#8217;t move on</p>
<p>Are we making the same mistake?<br />
Have we learned from the past?<br />
Could this be our second chance<br />
The one that&#8217;s gonna last?</p>
<p>On top of the world, I&#8217;m reaching out<br />
On top of the world, I sing out loud<br />
Just promise to never break my heart<br />
I&#8217;ll give you forever</p>
<p>On top of the world, just you and I<br />
So promise to never say goodbye<br />
Now I know, we are forever more</p>
<p>People may come and go<br />
But I need you to stay<br />
Deep within, I have always known<br />
That we would find a way</p>
<p>On top of the world, I&#8217;m reaching out<br />
On top of the world, I sing out loud<br />
Just promise to never break my heart<br />
I&#8217;ll give you forever</p>
<p>On top of the world, just you and I<br />
So promise to never say goodbye<br />
Now I know, we are forever more</p>
<p>I know we&#8217;ve tried it all before<br />
It will be better now, I&#8217;m sure<br />
I&#8217;ve been so blind, you make me see<br />
How strong I am when you&#8217;re with me</p>
<p>Say your love is here to stay<br />
Need you more every day</p>
<p>(On top of the world, I&#8217;m reaching out) Hey&#8230;<br />
(On top of the world, I sing out loud)<br />
Just promise to never break my heart<br />
I&#8217;ll give you forever</p>
<p>On top of the world, just you and I<br />
So promise to never say goodbye<br />
Now I know, we are forever more<br />
Yeah&#8230; now I know, we are forever more</p>
