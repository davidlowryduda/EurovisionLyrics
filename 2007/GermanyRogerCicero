Even back at school, the boys all laughed<br />
But I really didn&#8217;t care<br />
She was so cute, her legs were so long<br />
I went to her ballet class for almost a year</p>
<p>When I found out she was into the environment<br />
I stitched &#8220;no, thanks&#8221; onto my parka<br />
She didn&#8217;t care about that back then<br />
But since then, I know who rules the world</p>
<p>The way they walk and stand<br />
The way they look at you<br />
And your wallet and heart start to open up<br />
And you buy a ring and a mink coat</p>
<p>One seductive glance<br />
nd your political views start to change<br />
It&#8217;s not the boss or the action heroes<br />
It&#8217;s not the state or mafia money<br />
Women rule the world</p>
<p>All the stops, from coquettish to naive<br />
Even as babies, they had a hold on their fathers<br />
They give everything when there&#8217;s something they want<br />
And you bang your head against a brick wall when they&#8217;re sulking</p>
<p>You make a fool of yourself and let yourself get beaten up<br />
Just so the girls would look over just once<br />
They can push Beckham and overthrow Clinton<br />
Without even having to form a party</p>
<p>The way they walk and stand<br />
The way they look at you<br />
And your wallet and heart start to open up<br />
And you buy a ring and a mink coat</p>
<p>One seductive glance<br />
And your political views start to change<br />
It&#8217;s not the boss or the action heroes<br />
It&#8217;s not the state or mafia money<br />
Women rule the world</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
