<p>(Shake it, shake it)<br />
(Shake it, shake it)</p>
<p>She smiled at me, said: &#8220;Would you like it sweet and low?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I know a place where we can take it nice and slow&#8221;<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinkin': don&#8217;t stop, I need that sweet thing<br />
Telling you now, this is real</p>
<p>Shake it up, şekerim, I know what you&#8217;re feelin&#8217;<br />
Shake it up, şekerim, I got what you&#8217;re needin&#8217;<br />
Shake it up, şekerim, tell me what you&#8217;re thinkin&#8217;<br />
Shake it up, şekerim, you&#8217;re my only sweet thing</p>
<p>She said in a sexy lazy low key: &#8220;Can I make it right?&#8221;<br />
You put your trust in me, I&#8217;ll take you through the night<br />
Don&#8217;t keep me waiting, not sure you&#8217;re understanding<br />
Just how much I crave for you</p>
<p>Shake it up, şekerim, I know what you&#8217;re feelin&#8217;<br />

Shake it up, şekerim, tell me what you&#8217;re thinkin&#8217;<br />
Shake it up, şekerim, you&#8217;re my only sweet thing</p>
<p>Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time<br />
I got lots of candy to make you mine<br />
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time<br />
I got lots of candy for you</p>
