Take, take this flower in your hand<br />
Don&#8217;t ask how I&#8217;ll manage without you<br />
Put it on your heart<br />
Let it remind you of me</p>
<p>My white flower, my faraway world<br />
Come, return, be mine again<br />
Everything of me is forever yours in this lifetime<br />
Flower of the south, still close to the sea, I&#8217;m waiting for you<br />
I&#8217;m still waiting for you</p>
<p>(My white flower)</p>
<p>I love something that is not there anymore<br />
You&#8217;re just my vision from times past</p>
<p>My white flower (My white flower, my white flower)<br />
My faraway world (My white flower, my white flower)<br />
Come, return, be mine again<br />
Everything of me is forever yours in this lifetime<br />
Flower of the south, still close to the sea, I&#8217;m waiting for you</p>
<p>(My white flower, my faraway world)<br />
(Come, return, be mine again)<br />
Everything of me is forever yours in this lifetime<br />
Flower of the south, still close to the sea, I&#8217;m waiting for you<br />
I&#8217;m still waiting for you<br />
