<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>The world is full of terror, if someone makes an error<br />
He&#8217;s gonna blow us up to biddy biddy kingdom come<br />
There are some crazy rulers, they hide and try to fool us<br />
With demonic, technologic willingness to harm</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>They&#8217;re gonna push the button, push the button<br />
Push the bu&#8230; push the bu&#8230; push the button<br />
Push the button, push the button<br />
Push the bu&#8230; push the bu&#8230; push the button</em></font></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of suffering, in the streets there&#8217;s too much violence<br />
And we are very lucky to be alive, even unscathed<br />
Tactical advancement of a fanatical regime<br />
A tragic situation that brings tears to my eyes</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And I don&#8217;t wanna die<br />
I wanna see the flowers bloom, don&#8217;t wanna go kaput kaboom<br />
And I don&#8217;t wanna cry<br />
I wanna have a lot of fun just sitting in the sun<br />
But nevertheless</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>He&#8217;s gonna push the button, push the button<br />
Push the bu&#8230; push the bu&#8230; push the button<br />
Push the button, push the button<br />
Push the bu&#8230; push the bu&#8230; push the button</em></font></p>
<p>Messages are exploding on me<br />
Missiles are flying are also landing on me<br />
Cops and robbers are running all over me<br />
And they&#8217;re jumping me, getting on my case</p>
<p>Alas, alas, answer me, my God, hi<br />
This nightmare is too long<br />
When I&#8217;m barely alive and everyone is aiming at me<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s too early to sing that I gave her my life</p>
<p>Police, rescue team<br />
It made it to the Kdam, a song with no peace<br />
Red is not just a colour, it&#8217;s more like blood</p>
<p>Again I&#8217;m stopping the breathing in my heart<br />
So I won&#8217;t drop dead<br />
First it&#8217;s a war, now it&#8217;s resuscitation</p>
<p>Boom boom, that&#8217;s what is happening now<br />
In between a rocket and a machete, a viewer and a reporter<br />
Underhanded opportunism and a kidnapee, rain and a heatwave<br />
An escalation in the levels is setting up camp</p>
<p>Nothing, nothing, that&#8217;s what everyone is doing<br />
Hard-liners become more extreme and officers more serious<br />
The naive become more moderate, waiting for the data<br />
And reply (That everyone is helpless)</p>
<p>A world full of demons where we are nothing but pawns<br />
And champions with gambling chips decide the outcome<br />
Sluggish management, a ship filled with water<br />
And everyone is raising a toast and drowning side by side</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s too sharp<br />
We should sing songs of palm tree, desert songs with no flags<br />
I&#8217;m still alive, alive, alive<br />
And if it keeps on being scary, only then will I say</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;m gonna push the button, push the button<br />
Push the bu&#8230; push the bu&#8230; push the button<br />
Push the button, push the button<br />
Push the bu&#8230; push the bu&#8230; push the button</em></font><br />
