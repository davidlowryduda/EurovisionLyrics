<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The smell of your lips is like rain<br />
To touch them is sinful, and for fulfilment I pray<br />
My dream will come into you<br />
And won&#8217;t leave you alone in the darkness</p>
<p>My chord untouched<br />
You are untouched by me<br />
My dream is pouring you its wine<br />
In that night of ours</p>
<p>Every blossom of night has closed its eyes<br />
Yet so deep is the heaven of yours<br />
Flowers, like you, are crying without love<br />
And dreaming dreams same as you</p>
<p>My chord untouched<br />
You are untouched by me<br />
My dream is pouring you its wine<br />
In that night of ours</p>
<p>My chord untouched<br />
You are untouched by me<br />
My dream is pouring you its wine<br />
In that night of ours<br />
