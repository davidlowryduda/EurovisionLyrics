When I&#8217;m with her<br />
I&#8217;m a labyrinth of indecision<br />
When I&#8217;m with her<br />
I play with my imagination</p>
<p>She gives me her smile<br />
And, in my hurry, I usually drown myself<br />
And tell her to stop<br />
And she pursues my moments of fire</p>
<p>She, she&#8217;s not her<br />
She&#8217;s the other woman, the one that motivates me<br />
And she&#8217;s in my memory<br />
The other woman is the one I could never forget</p>
<p>No, she, she&#8217;s not her<br />
She&#8217;s the other woman, the one that excites me<br />
And burns my clothes<br />
The other woman is the stone and I&#8217;m the volcano</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m with her<br />
I know everything gets worse<br />
And when I think of the other one<br />
I&#8217;m almost, almost a god</p>
<p>She brings down the moon for me<br />
The other woman awakes my animal instinct<br />
The other woman is my luck<br />
My naked muse, my best remedy</p>
<p>She, she&#8217;s not her<br />
She&#8217;s the other woman, the one that motivates me<br />
And she&#8217;s in my memory<br />
The other woman is the one I could never forget</p>
<p>No, she, she&#8217;s not her<br />
She&#8217;s the other womab, the one that excites me<br />
And burns my clothes<br />
The other woman is the stone and I&#8217;m the volcano<br />
