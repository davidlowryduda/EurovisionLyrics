I remember well the magic times<br />
Such a long time ago<br />
Come &#8211; let&#8217;s return back, to when we had our own world<br />
And someone stole it from us<br />
No I don&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s been lost long ago</p>
<p>My love, do you remember that song<br />
Our sign<br />
That it&#8217;s telling you &#8211; come back, come back, come back<br />
No need to be afraid of returns</p>
<p>I know that you let yourself be lead astray and the world lured you away<br />
And you&#8217;re dreaming of happiness<br />
The time can&#8217;t be put aback, but I am still yours<br />
And it doesn&#8217;t end for me<br />
You know that this is your land and that shall never change</p>
<p>My love, do you remember that song<br />
Our sign<br />
That it&#8217;s telling you – come back, come back, come back<br />
No need to be afraid of returns</p>
<p>My love, do you remember that song<br />
Our sign<br />
That it&#8217;s telling you – come back, come back, come back<br />
No need to be afraid of returns</p>
<p>Listen to our song, my love far away<br />
Flying to you through the night, you know what it means<br />
