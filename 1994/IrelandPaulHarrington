<p>I remember sixty-two<br />
I was sixteen and so were you<br />
And we lived next door on the avenue</p>
<p>Jerry Lee was big and Elvis too<br />
Blue jeans and blue suede shoes<br />
And we never knew what life held in store<br />
We just wanted to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll forever more</p>
<p>We were the rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll kids<br />
Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll was all we did<br />
And listenin&#8217; to those songs on the radio</p>
<p>I was yours and you were mine<br />
That was once upon a time<br />
Now we never seem to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll anymore</p>
<p>Now Johnny&#8217;s in love with the girl next door<br />
And Mary&#8217;s down at the record store<br />
They don&#8217;t wanna be around us no more</p>
<p>Golden oldies, but we hardly speak<br />
Too busy running to a different beat<br />
Hard to understand we were once like them<br />
How I wish we could find those rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll days again</p>
<p>We were the rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll kids<br />
Rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll was all we did<br />
And listenin&#8217; to those songs on the radio</p>
<p>I was yours and you were mine<br />
That was once upon a time<br />
Now we never seem to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll anymore</p>
<p>I was yours and you were mine<br />
That was once upon a time<br />
Now we never seem to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
We just never seem to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll anymore</p>
