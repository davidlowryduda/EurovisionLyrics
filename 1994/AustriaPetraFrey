<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Words that hurt and pictures that scream<br />
Flying flags in the wind<br />
Frontiers that lies and nobody knows anymore<br />
And people almost blinded by tears</p>
<p>Sometimes I hear a song deep in me<br />
That tells me about love<br />
Longing for freedom and for a world<br />
Where everybody understands each other</p>
<p>For the peace of the world, for the hope for light<br />
For the truth that nobody sees anymore<br />
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore<br />
For them I sing you this song</p>
<p>For the peace of the world, for the hope for light<br />
For the truth that nobody sees anymore<br />
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore<br />
For them I sing you this song<br />
For them I sing you this song</p>
<p>Entreating hearts in the darkness of the night<br />
When will they see light again?<br />
Who will give the laughter back to the children<br />
Before their hope is broken?</p>
<p>For the peace of the world, for the hope for light<br />
For the truth that nobody sees anymore<br />
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore<br />
For them I sing you this song</p>
<p>And it can&#8217;t still be that you need courage<br />
To show love to others</p>
<p>For the peace of the world, for the hope for light<br />
For the truth that nobody sees anymore<br />
For the people that are cold and that nobody hears anymore<br />
For them I sing you this song<br />
Ah&#8230; this song<br />
