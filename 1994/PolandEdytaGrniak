My world is so easy<br />
Under a white-black sky<br />
The people are cut out of grey pages<br />
From the interior of books</p>
<p>They are beautiful from the background romance<br />
You are tired of a newspaper that is cut out<br />
And I&#8230; I&#8217;m white, a clean card<br />
Amongst you</p>
<p>I was not Eve<br />
I had not stolen heaven<br />
Though I&#8217;m tired of tears, my tears, so many tears<br />
I&#8217;m born to love myself</p>
<p>I was not Eve<br />
I had not stolen heaven<br />
Don&#8217;t blame it on me once more, that&#8217;s not me, that&#8217;s not me<br />
Not me, I&#8217;m not Eve</p>
<p>The sky blows chilly<br />
Hell bows deeply with its flames to its feet<br />
And I&#8230; a marionette of paper, I have to play</p>
<p>I was not Eve<br />
I had not stolen heaven<br />
Though I&#8217;m tired of tears, my tears, so many tears<br />
I&#8217;m born to love, I know it</p>
<p>Before I turn to ashes<br />
I want to be a big flame<br />
I want to look down on earth<br />
Want to warm up the sky with dreams</p>
<p>(I was not Eve)<br />
(I had not stolen heaven)<br />
No, no, no, no&#8230;</p>
<p>(I was not Eve)<br />
(I had not stolen heaven)<br />
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no&#8230;<br />
