Rain from the north is coming<br />
The pillow smells nice, but your infidelity is hurting me<br />
You&#8217;re not here, the morning awakens me<br />
He who kissed you destroyed memories in my eyes</p>
<p>Someone took you away from me<br />
You sold me, whoa&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m fighting for love, but don&#8217;t have the strength<br />
No, I don&#8217;t have the strength</p>
<p>You may have all the love (All)<br />
My soul is too tired<br />
The biggest pain is going through my veins<br />
But you won&#8217;t disappear from inside me, oh&#8230;<br />
Won&#8217;t disappear, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t love me, you don&#8217;t love me anymore<br />
My love would have lasted a hundred years</p>
<p>You may have all the love (All)<br />
My soul is too tired<br />
The biggest pain is going through my veins</p>
<p>You may have all the love (All)<br />
My soul is too tired<br />
But you won&#8217;t disappear from inside me, oh&#8230;<br />
Won&#8217;t disappear</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230;<br />
