You are not with me, you are far away<br />
It&#8217;s not easy to live in different worlds<br />
Maybe only a dream can help me<br />
To see and touch you</p>
<p>And the night passes by, your voice is far away<br />
And I shout to you from over the seas:<br />
&#8220;In our house is still your warmth&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But the house is empty without you&#8221;<br />
In this house there is just me</p>
<p>Eternal wanderer, I&#8217;m your destiny<br />
I know, you will remember me<br />
You are always on the way, but there is always<br />
A bright light for you in my window</p>
<p>There is the sunrise, the dawn<br />
In the sky glow bright and coloured<br />
In the silence of morning I&#8217;m not alone:<br />
The new day brings the meeting with you</p>
<p>And the night passes by, your voice is far away<br />
And I shout to you from over the seas:<br />
&#8220;In our house is still your warmth&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But the house is empty without you&#8221;<br />
In this house there is just me</p>
<p>Eternal wanderer, I&#8217;m your destiny<br />
I know, you will remember me<br />
You are always on the way, but there is always<br />
A bright light for you in my window</p>
<p>Eternal wanderer, I&#8217;m your destiny<br />
I know, you will remember me<br />
You are always on the way, but there is always<br />
A bright light for you in my window<br />
