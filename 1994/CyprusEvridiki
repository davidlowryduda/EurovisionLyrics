I don&#8217;t wait for a special day<br />
Like a Sunday which doesn&#8217;t<br />
Fit my awful silence<br />
To wake up with an immortal kiss</p>
<p>A shiny night, you&#8217;ll get hidden again<br />
You shake as a boy in case they discover<br />
You put on the uniform so that<br />
No how&#8217;s and why&#8217;s can touch you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a person too, and I will shout tonight<br />
I&#8217;m a person too, I&#8217;m fed up, I&#8217;ll change<br />
You&#8217;re a person too, you&#8217;ve got my own life in your hands<br />
And before I manage to tell you that I love you<br />
You kill me, but I&#8217;m a person too</p>
<p>And when in morning in the mirror<br />
I&#8217;ll be afraid to look at myself, in case I call myself a liar<br />
I&#8217;ll be asking if I made all these marks<br />
I had in mind</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a person too, and I will shout tonight<br />
I&#8217;m a person too, I&#8217;m fed up, I&#8217;ll change<br />
You&#8217;re a person too, you&#8217;ve got my own life in your hands<br />
And before I manage to tell you that</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a person too<br />
A piece of the same God of yours<br />
And I&#8217;m entitled to cry, to laugh, to feel pain<br />
Below the same sky where others fly, I&#8217;ll fly<br />
But I&#8217;m a person too</p>
<p>And I have your own life in my hands<br />
And before you manage to tell me you love me<br />
I kill you</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m a person too<br />
I&#8217;m a person too<br />
