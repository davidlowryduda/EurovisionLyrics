Where have you been?<br />
Where did you go to?<br />
I&#8217;ve even written you<br />
But now I&#8217;m so tired</p>
<p>I had burried myself<br />
I lost everything<br />
My safe haven<br />
My peace, my struggle</p>
<p>Where is the sun<br />
That will warm me?<br />
Where are your arms<br />
And where is the source?</p>
<p>Where is the light<br />
That will shine at last?<br />
That makes the cold disappear?<br />
I&#8217;m looking for your face</p>
<p>The pain is gone<br />
But the chilliness, it remains<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for that one thing<br />
That will chase the silence away</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for a sign<br />
A voice or a word<br />
That will break this through<br />
I hope you can hear me</p>
<p>But where is the sun<br />
That will warm me?<br />
Where are your arms<br />
And where is the source?</p>
<p>Where is the light<br />
That will shine at last?<br />
That makes the cold disappear?<br />
I&#8217;m looking for your face</p>
<p>And suddenly you were there<br />
I saw you going again<br />
I even stepped aside<br />
But you were still standing next to me</p>
<p>You were still walking next to me<br />
You came home again<br />
My heart opened again<br />
I&#8217;m settled down again</p>
<p>You are the sun<br />
That will warm me<br />
Your strong arms<br />
They form my source</p>
<p>You are the light<br />
That will shine again now<br />
That makes the cold disappear<br />
I see your face<br />
