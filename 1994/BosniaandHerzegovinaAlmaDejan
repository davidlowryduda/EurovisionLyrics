<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
You&#8217;re the only one who can lighten up this darkness I am feeling<br />
With you, I am like a happy child although I don&#8217;t look like it<br />
Years, one by one, like a train and a station<br />
Only we&#8217;re at the last one</p>
<p>Stay beside me<br />
You are all my hope<br />
You are all my strength<br />
All my happiness and stay because of that<br />
My love</p>
<p>In your eyes, there&#8217;s a blue river through which hatred will never flow<br />
Your heart knows the sweet words said when one&#8217;s in love<br />
Years, step by step and all the pain will vanish<br />
Except this song, me and you</p>
<p>Stay beside me<br />
You are all my hope<br />
You are all my strength<br />
All my happiness and stay because of that<br />
My love<br />
