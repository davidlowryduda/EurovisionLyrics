Nothing is there, only the light-less night<br />
Only the tongue-tied distress, a vain hope<br />
No faith, no love<br />
No one to stroke my hand</p>
<p>Whom can I tell my sins<br />
To be sure that they are forgiven?<br />
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?</p>
<p>The night is cold, but there remains a longing for light<br />
When the swallows move south<br />
My body is chilling during that dream<br />
While the ardour slumbers in the birds of fire</p>
<p>Whom can I tell my sins<br />
To be sure that they are forgiven?<br />
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?</p>
<p>It never erupts<br />
It will stay away of the bareness<br />
Of my blindfold eyes<br />
My God, tell me why</p>
<p>Salty tears<br />
In spite of nobody dying and no children being born</p>
<p>How can I tell my sins<br />
To be sure that they are forgiven?<br />
Whom can I tell my sins<br />
To get rid of my heavy guilt</p>
<p>To be sure that they are forgiven?<br />
Whom can I tell my sins, my God?<br />
