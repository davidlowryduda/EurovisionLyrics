With your song, warmth enters<br />
Brings spring into a frozen mind<br />
Through ice, the song finds its way<br />
To a river, deep inside me</p>
<p>The ice melts, the river awakens<br />
The power of the flood fills mind and body<br />
First as tears from a spring<br />
Inside yourself that breaks free</p>
<p>And now the waterfall is free and wild<br />
Like dancers of fire, a powerful current<br />
We are one with the warmth of our blood<br />
With the strength of our faith in a song</p>
<p>Dare to give to set the spring loose<br />
The song lives under everything that froze<br />
The flood turns into a waterfall<br />
The spring in crystal breaks through</p>
<p>And now the waterfall is free and wild<br />
Like dancers of fire, a powerful current<br />
We are one with the warmth of our blood<br />
With the strength of our faith in a song</p>
<p>Free, like flames in a dance<br />
Duet in mind and sense for the first time<br />
We are one with the warmth of our blood<br />
With the strength of our faith</p>
<p>In a song<br />
