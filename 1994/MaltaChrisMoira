<p>Swiftly movin&#8217; on, the days I see<br />
Often ask myself what I really wanna be<br />
To dream of an aim, to reach it with fame<br />
Not easy to say, there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way</p>
<p>More than love what music gives to me<br />
Body and soul live in reality</p>
<p>Glistening on a star of promises and dreams<br />
Some take me for a laugh, but they don&#8217;t know what it means<br />
To tell you the truth I&#8217;ll never change my youth<br />
Not easy to say, there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way</p>
<p>More than love what music gives to me<br />
Body and soul livin&#8217; in harmony</p>
<p>More than love (Please, God, hear me now)<br />
What music gives to me (You gotta help me, you gotta help me)<br />
Body and soul live in reality (Ho, ho)</p>
<p>More than love (Please, God)<br />
What music gives to me (You gotta help me, yeah)<br />
Body and soul there for eternity</p>
<p>This life is what I own, gotta make it through<br />
I&#8217;m liftin&#8217; up my heart and I&#8217;m givin&#8217; it to you</p>
