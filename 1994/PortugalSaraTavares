Tonight I&#8217;m going to stay like this<br />
A prisoner of that look of honey which is in me<br />
I&#8217;m going to call the music<br />
Going to test my voice in a song just for the two of us</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;m going to drink alcohol<br />
Like a forgiving filter of love, love, love<br />
I&#8217;m going to call the music<br />
Going to hold your hand, going to compose a song</p>
<p>Call the music, the music<br />
Having it so near me<br />
Like the wind in the desert<br />
Woken inside of me</p>
<p>Call the music, the music<br />
The muse of my themes<br />
In this night of strangeness<br />
Just holding you is calling the music</p>
<p>Tonight I don&#8217;t want TV<br />
Nor the sheet of ordinary newspaper that no one reads<br />
I&#8217;ll call the music<br />
To whisper a madrigal, to create a ritual</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;m serving tea<br />
Made of herbs and jasmine and aromas that don&#8217;t exist<br />
I&#8217;m going to call the music<br />
Find arising from me, a satin poem</p>
<p>Call the music, the music<br />
Having it so near me<br />
Like the wind in the desert<br />
Woken inside of me</p>
<p>Call the music, the music<br />
The muse of my themes<br />
In this night of strangeness<br />
Just holding you is calling the music<br />
