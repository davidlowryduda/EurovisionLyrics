<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The coming day you may listen to me<br />
I have chosen the bad as well as the good<br />
Part of myself I leave in your hands</p>
<p>Nights without dreams, questions without answer<br />
I wake up my hidden soul from my memories</p>
<p>Beyond the clouds, there is a ray of light<br />
Beyond the clouds, there is my world, the world</p>
<p>I am not asking for forgiveness for all I have done<br />
I am asking for a ray of love to start all over again</p>
<p>I now have the power now to make a change in the world<br />
I have the power to dream</p>
<p>(Beyond the clouds, beyond the clouds)<br />
Beyond the clouds (Beyond the clouds)<br />
There is my world, there is my world (Beyond the clouds)<br />
There is my world, world, world, world, world (Beyond the clouds)<br />
There is my world</p>
<p>(Beyond the clouds)<br />
There is my world<br />
