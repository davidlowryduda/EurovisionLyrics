<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I arrive secretly, as a wave<br />
That brings the amber to the shore<br />
And the taste of sea on my lips is earthly<br />
When garment flickers as a wing</p>
<p>I can be as ice or burning hot, the core of your every dream<br />
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow<br />
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may<br />
Become just a name on your lips</p>
<p>And I also change as a wave<br />
That considers borders as nothing<br />
You are a man and I am a woman<br />
I know some things, that you don&#8217;t know</p>
<p>I can be as ice or burning hot, the core of your every dream<br />
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow<br />
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may<br />
Become just a name on your lips</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like a day, you&#8217;re a night<br />
One is the sea, the other just as the land<br />
How many feelings can there be between us<br />
No one can intuit, the sea will change, so does the land</p>
<p>I can be as ice or burning hot, the core of your every dream<br />
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow<br />
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may<br />
Become just a name on your lips</p>
<p>(I can be as ice or burning hot) The core of your every dream<br />
And in the white night even faithful than a shadow<br />
So I brought myself to you, though I know, tomorrow I may<br />
Become just a name on your lips</p>
<p>Become just a name on your lips<br />
