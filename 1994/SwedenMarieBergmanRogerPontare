Good morning, my sun<br />
Tell me, did you wake up to give me some of your glory<br />
Or will you disappear somewhere in a rainshower<br />
Where your tears become a mirror of the solitude I feel right now?</p>
<p>But if you give me some of the light you have<br />
The day will stay until the moon enlightens</p>
<p>The stars, enlightening my night<br />
Giving power to our love<br />
Leading us when the winds are changing</p>
<p>The stars, ruling with the hand of destiny<br />
When hearts are set on fire<br />
Which lead us to the land of dreams<br />
Oh&#8230; come and take my hand, follow me tonight</p>
<p>Good morning, my sun<br />
Imagine that I could see all the things that only you can see<br />
Then I knew all the things that you know<br />
About what will happen with the two of us tomorrow<br />
If only you stay</p>
<p>So if you gave me some of your light<br />
The day will remain until the moon turns on</p>
<p>The stars, enlightening my night<br />
Giving power to our love<br />
Leading us when the winds are changing</p>
<p>The stars, ruling with the hand of destiny<br />
When hearts are set on fire<br />
And I can&#8217;t send a thought</p>
<p>The stars, enlightening my night<br />
Giving power to our love<br />
Leading us&#8230;</p>
<p>The stars, ruling with the hand of destiny<br />
When hearts are set on fire<br />
To the land of dreams, oh&#8230; take my hand<br />
Oh&#8230; take my hand, follow me tonight<br />
