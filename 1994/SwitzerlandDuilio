I&#8217;m praying for someone who has not yet realized<br />
That life just has a big pain<br />
Who believes what is written, will be certainly reborn<br />
On a great and sweet day</p>
<p>I&#8217;m praying for you, for all the evil around<br />
Which surrounds life<br />
I&#8217;m praying for everybody, for the destroyed dreams<br />
Why don&#8217;t you believe it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m praying tomorrow, the sky, the sun, the stars<br />
To forgive all the sins<br />
I&#8217;m praying for those who are looking for love<br />
And don&#8217;t know where</p>
<p>I&#8217;m praying for you, for all the evil around<br />
Which surrounds life<br />
I&#8217;m praying for everybody, for the destroyed dreams<br />
Why don&#8217;t you believe it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m praying tomorrow, the sky, the sun, the stars<br />
To forgive all the sins<br />
I&#8217;m praying for those who are looking for love<br />
And don&#8217;t know where</p>
<p>I&#8217;m praying in the silence of memories<br />
That the time of my dreams may stay here again<br />
A light will shine for those who know<br />
How to find the sun in the darkness<br />
