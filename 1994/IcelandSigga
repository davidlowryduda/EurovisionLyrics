Nights, land of dreams<br />
Dark blue sky above the horizon<br />
Nights, there you are<br />
There I drift in my dream</p>
<p>All that I wish for is woven in the white clouds<br />
Grand thoughts, in the twilight it&#8217;s you that I enjoy<br />
As night falls I disappear, where my mind takes me<br />
Sleep beckons, lures me away<br />
The path is clear</p>
<p>Nights, land of dreams<br />
Dark blue sky above the horizon<br />
Nights, there you are<br />
There I drift in my dream</p>
<p>Everything that no one can see, I spot in the middle of the night<br />
As I sleep I send you my message, yes<br />
The silence carries such secrets, over there</p>
<p>(Nights) Oh, land of dreams<br />
Dark blue sky above the horizon<br />
Nights, there you are<br />
There I drift (In my dream)</p>
<p>And tonight, silently, I am there<br />
Still, soaring in my mind<br />
Creep in, this time, I capture you</p>
<p>(Nights) Oh, land of dreams<br />
Dark blue sky above the horizon<br />
Nights, there you are<br />
There I drift in my dream<br />
Message to you</p>
<p>(Nights) There you are<br />
There I drift in my dream<br />
(And tonight, silently) Now in a dream<br />
(And tonight, silently) Now in a dream<br />
