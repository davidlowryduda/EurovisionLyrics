When I looked at your blue eyes<br />
I believed so to find happiness from you<br />
I loved you, forgot the others<br />
I wanted you to be my own</p>
<p>But I got to hear<br />
That I&#8217;m not the only one for you<br />
When I close the door last time carefully<br />
You are history to me</p>
<p>Bye bye baby, baby goodbye<br />
I&#8217;ll go away, though I&#8217;m left alone<br />
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye<br />
I won&#8217;t cry, when this ends</p>
<p>When I take a look back, you&#8217;re only a memory<br />
A memory of a past love<br />
You&#8217;ll find another<br />
Who falls in love with you, believes your lies</p>
<p>Still I&#8217;ll trust in love, the eternal power<br />
I have a destination, yesterday stays behind<br />
It was a deceptive dream</p>
<p>Bye bye baby, baby goodbye<br />
I&#8217;ll go away, though I&#8217;m left alone<br />
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye<br />
I won&#8217;t cry, when this ends</p>
<p>If I dare start love again<br />
Maybe tomorrow reaches happiness again</p>
<p>Bye bye baby, baby goodbye<br />
I&#8217;ll go away, though I&#8217;m left alone<br />
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye<br />
I won&#8217;t cry, when this ends</p>
<p>Bye bye baby, baby goodbye<br />
I&#8217;ll go away, though I&#8217;m left alone<br />
Bye bye baby, baby, goodbye<br />
I won&#8217;t cry, when this ends<br />
