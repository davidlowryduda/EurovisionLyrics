<p>Walk into the box, let your secrets out<br />
Time for confession<br />
Purify your soul, denounce the devil from within<br />
No time for aggression</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you see the piece of dust<br />
That crumbles in your hand is me?<br />
Give me some affection</p>
<p>And though my heart is broken<br />
My picture is forgotten but I still believe<br />
That I can see a piece of me reflecting in your eye</p>
<p>(We will rise)<br />
(Never fall) Never fall<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>(We will rise) We will rise<br />
(Never fall again) We&#8217;ll never fall again<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>Welcome to the land where all our dreams are planned<br />
And fighting is a thing to do<br />
Sometimes it makes me feel<br />
Naked like a tree in autumn</p>
<p>And while you dance beneath an angry star<br />
I&#8217;m chasing rainbows across the sun<br />
And in this mad equation I still believe that we can be<br />
In harmony, you and me a chorus in your lonely symphony</p>
<p>(We will rise)<br />
(Never fall) We&#8217;ll never fall<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>(We will rise) We will rise<br />
(Never fall again) We&#8217;ll never fall again<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>(We will rise)<br />
(Never fall) We&#8217;ll never fall<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>(We will rise)<br />
(Never fall) We&#8217;ll never fall<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>(We will rise) We will rise<br />
(Never fall again) We&#8217;ll never fall again<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
<p>With a little love<br />
(We will rise) We will be free<br />
(Never fall again) We&#8217;ll never fall<br />
(We will be free) And we will be free</p>
