Love, what are you doing here?<br />
The party&#8217;s over<br />
Tell me, what are you playing?</p>
<p>Love, what happened, happened<br />
We said it&#8217;s over<br />
What are you looking for?</p>
<p>Love, I don&#8217;t want to treat you badly<br />
It&#8217;s better not to insist<br />
There&#8217;s no more magic in your hands</p>
<p>Love, excuse me if I say love<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my intention<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s because I loved you<br />
And now I don&#8217;t</p>
<p>The party&#8217;s over<br />
There&#8217;s only a fog between you and me<br />
Why throwing more wood to burn<br />
When the fire is already dull? Tell me</p>
<p>Love, I&#8217;m finally over you<br />
And I&#8217;m not thinking about going back<br />
Again to my old tricks</p>
<p>Love, excuse me if I say love<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my intention<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s because I loved you<br />
And now I don&#8217;t</p>
<p>The party&#8217;s over<br />
There&#8217;s only a fog between you and me<br />
Why throwing more wood to burn<br />
When the fire is already dull? Tell me</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t insist anymore, the party&#8217;s over<br />
You and I are no longer you and I<br />
Why should we love each other without love?<br />
Why should we keep on lying to each other?<br />
Tell me, tell me<br />
