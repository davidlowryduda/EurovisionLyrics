How many people are awake<br />
In a clear, starry night?<br />
They don&#8217;t know what exactly will come tomorrow<br />
And still they are dreaming about it</p>
<p>They believe in tenderness<br />
And that there will be a bit of hope left<br />
In little things and in a distant aim<br />
And also in a feeling</p>
<p>For everyone here, who can see the rainbow in the darkness<br />
And the truth which is always hidden<br />
For everyone here, who can understand the unspoken words<br />
For all of them I&#8217;m singing a song</p>
<p>For everything here, for the wishes that stand in children&#8217;s eyes<br />
For the dreams and for the fantasy<br />
And for the courage, that fights the doubts and the fear<br />
For everyone I&#8217;m singing a song</p>
<p>Thoughts often turn around<br />
And dreams have their own price<br />
But for as long as there are people<br />
Yearning still has a song</p>
<p>For everyone here, who can see the rainbow in the darkness<br />
And the truth which is always hidden<br />
For everyone here, who can understand the unspoken words<br />
For all of them I&#8217;m singing a song</p>
<p>For everyone here, for the wishes, that stands in children&#8217;s eyes<br />
For the dreams and for the fantasy<br />
And for the courage that fights the doubts and the fear<br />
For all of them is this song<br />
