<p>Wait until the weekend comes<br />
Then we&#8217;ll have what time it takes<br />
To sort it out, to see it through</p>
<p>Wait until the weekend comes<br />
Sundays always change your mind<br />
And make you laugh about me and you</p>
<p>Hold me now, really don&#8217;t want you to go<br />
Really don&#8217;t want you to go, and I&#8217;m so afraid<br />
Hold me now, really don&#8217;t want you to know<br />
Really don&#8217;t want you to know that I&#8217;m so afraid</p>
<p>Wait until the summer comes<br />
Sunshine looks so good on you<br />
We&#8217;ll catch the tide and start anew</p>
<p>Hold me now, really don&#8217;t want you to go<br />
Really don&#8217;t want you to go, and I&#8217;m so afraid<br />
Hold me now, really don&#8217;t want you to know<br />
Really don&#8217;t want you to know that I&#8217;m so afraid</p>
<p>Wait until the rainbow ends<br />
Then we&#8217;ll find our pot of gold<br />
Lovers, friends, just growin&#8217; old<br />
So wait until the weekend comes and goes<br />
Wait until the weekend comes and goes</p>
