An hour passed, well probably more<br />
And I keep speculating:<br />
Now, who was it, that you were?<br />
Then I finally got an answer, it was obvious</p>
<p>When we were kids we were friends<br />
In the yard at home, we often played theatre<br />
When someone asked who we should look like, you&#8217;d answer:</p>
<p>Would you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)<br />
Would you like to know, then just ask me<br />
Come along to our dream island<br />
Where you can get exactly what you want</p>
<p>Would you like to know? (Say it once more)<br />
Would you like to know? Don&#8217;t you see<br />
If you want to, we&#8217;ll go to<br />
The place where everything can happen</p>
<p>I cautiously went to the jockey of the place<br />
And asked for something with a bit less rock<br />
I saw you get up and come this way<br />
Straight towards me</p>
<p>Did you still remember me? I think so<br />
You wanted to dance with me, but as you asked<br />
I couldn&#8217;t really help laughing and saying:</p>
<p>Would you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)<br />
Would you like to know, then just ask me<br />
Come along to our dream island<br />
Where you can get exactly what you want</p>
<p>Would you like to know? (Say it once more)<br />
Would you like to know? Don&#8217;t you see<br />
If only you want to, we&#8217;ll go to my secret place<br />
If you want to, then come along<br />
(Would you like&#8230;?) No!</p>
<p>Would you like to know? (Do you dare or not?)<br />
Would you like to know, then just ask me<br />
Come along to our dream island<br />
Where you can get exactly what you want</p>
<p>Would you like to know? (Say it once more)<br />
Would you like to know? Yeah<br />
If you want to, we&#8217;ll go to<br />
The place where everything can happen<br />
