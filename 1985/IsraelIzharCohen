<p>Light and azure in the sky, and suddenly the day appears<br />
Clouds turn into water, a rainbow rises in the heavens<br />
A variety of shades and a light of the sky that colour the world<br />
And it&#8217;s far more beautiful and it smiles to everyone</p>
<p>Together the song goes up and up<br />
When joy blossoms in your heart<br />
Together the song goes up and up<br />
Big and small, like a rainbow</p>
<p>To each other wanting to approach, together asking to dream<br />
To one another weaving a rainbow, peace has a thousand colours<br />
So they come to sing tonight from the four corners of the world<br />
The joy in the heart is not enough, a moment of light for all</p>
<p>Together the song goes up and up<br />
When joy blossoms in your heart<br />
Together the song goes up and up<br />
Big and small, like a rainbow</p>
<p>And meanwhile the song grows louder, bringing the hearts together<br />
Angels spread their wings and the candles are lit</p>
<p>Together the song goes up and up<br />
When joy blossoms in your heart<br />
Together the song goes up and up<br />
Big and small, like a rainbow</p>
<p>Together the song goes up and up<br />
When joy blossoms in your heart<br />
Together the song goes up and up<br />
Big and small, like a rainbow</p>
<p>Nana nana&#8230; nanana nana&#8230;<br />
Nanana nana na&#8230;<br />
Together the song goes up and up<br />
Big and small, like a rainbow</p>
<p>Like a rainbow<br />
(Like a rainbow)<br />
