I know the rain is falling outside<br />
The sleep is already gone and I loved you again<br />
I know (Thinking of you, thinking of you)<br />
When the sun rises (Thinking of you, thinking of you)<br />
I&#8217;ll have to lose my fear of telling you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s going to change<br />
It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s going to leave, maybe I&#8217;m even going to cry<br />
I don&#8217;t know what there is to come<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m going to lie, what&#8217;s over is over<br />
The rain is falling outside</p>
<p>I know (Thinking of you, thinking of you)<br />
That the sadness comes (Thinking of you, thinking of you)<br />
By leaving someone to whom I&#8217;ve given so much of myself</p>
<p>I know (Thinking of you, thinking of you)<br />
I might lose (Thinking of you, thinking of you)<br />
It doesn&#8217;t matter whom it hurts, I&#8217;ll have to tell you: no</p>
<p>It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s going to change<br />
It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s going to leave, maybe I&#8217;m even going to cry<br />
I don&#8217;t know what there is to come<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m going to lie, what&#8217;s over is over<br />
The rain is falling outside</p>
<p>Know, it&#8217;s me who&#8217;s going to change<br />
It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s going to leave, maybe I&#8217;m even going to cry<br />
I don&#8217;t know what there is to come<br />
