It&#8217;s night in the city but I don&#8217;t see any stars<br />
A thousand stars aren&#8217;t shining<br />
They&#8217;re left behind a grey veil</p>
<p>It&#8217;s night in the city, I stayed in the park with you<br />
You&#8217;re standing in front me full of hope<br />
And your eyes are telling me this</p>
<p>Long live life and the night<br />
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars<br />
Wish like I do that a star doesn&#8217;t hit a star</p>
<p>The feeling of sympathy<br />
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs<br />
So that the children of the world can watch the stars</p>
<p>It&#8217;s night in the city, I see your starry eyes<br />
Under a good friends arm<br />
I&#8217;ll hide my furry head</p>
<p>I am happy because I stayed with you<br />
You&#8217;re standing in front of me full of hope<br />
And your eyes are telling me this</p>
<p>Long live life and the night<br />
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars<br />
Wish like I do that a star doesn&#8217;t hit a star</p>
<p>The feeling of sympathy<br />
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs<br />
So that the children of the world can watch the stars</p>
<p>I stayed here full of hope<br />
Because your eyes are telling me this</p>
<p>Long live life and the night<br />
Long live the dark sky and the belt of stars<br />
Wish like I do that a star doesn&#8217;t hit a star</p>
<p>The feeling of sympathy<br />
Which grandfather told of is what the earth needs<br />
So that the children of the world can watch the stars<br />
