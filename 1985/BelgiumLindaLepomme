Let me go now<br />
Say no more, let me go now<br />
Don&#8217;t you feel<br />
Your words are not helping me anymore for a long time</p>
<p>Please, let me go<br />
Forget me, please let me go<br />
Didn&#8217;t you ever see<br />
That no love can live without warmth</p>
<p>And that I want to dream my life again<br />
As if I had never met you?</p>
<p>Never again<br />
I want to be with you, you hurt me<br />
Never again<br />
I want someone else to live my life</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t touch me<br />
No, don&#8217;t touch me<br />
Leave me alone<br />
I saw the world only through your eyes</p>
<p>I feel betrayed, I loved you<br />
You never understood that, never understood</p>
<p>Do you see now what I always wanted to tell you?<br />
Then you also know how long an empty night can last<br />
When one hopes and waits, exhausted and tired of thinking<br />
Do you realise now something in me will break when I leave you?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me go<br />
Please look at me<br />
Don&#8217;t let me go<br />
Do you really let me go like this?<br />
