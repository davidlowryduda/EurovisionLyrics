It&#8217;s the wind, it&#8217;s the rain, it&#8217;s the child too<br />
From silences to challenges, she likes the night<br />
Sometimes sad, she puts the weapons down<br />
Innocent or charming, she&#8217;s a woman</p>
<p>Woman, in her life, in her dreams too<br />
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions<br />
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman<br />
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances</p>
<p>Melody, melodrama, smile and then tears<br />
In love or without soul, first of all she&#8217;s woman</p>
<p>Woman, in her life, in her dreams too<br />
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions<br />
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman<br />
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances</p>
<p>Woman, in her life, in her dreams too<br />
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances</p>
<p>And who dances&#8230; dances&#8230;<br />
Dances&#8230; dances&#8230;<br />
Dances&#8230; dances&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh, woman, in her life, in her dreams too<br />
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions<br />
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman<br />
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances</p>
<p>In her dreams too<br />
Woman, in her eyes, her cries, her confessions<br />
Woman, beloved woman and loving woman<br />
Woman, elegance, and woman who dances</p>
<p>Who dances<br />
