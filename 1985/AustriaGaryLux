Ah&#8230;</p>
<p>Light on the people that you can&#8217;t see<br />
Rain on land where the harvest glows<br />
Songs of light for the children of this world</p>
<p>Courage for the weak, who don&#8217;t defend themselves<br />
Destinations for those who cross the desert<br />
Songs of light for the children of this world</p>
<p>More flowers in the asphalt (The children)<br />
Emotions instead of violence (The children)<br />
A morning behind the horizon for all children of this world</p>
<p>Brightness in those eyes, which are blunt and empty<br />
Dreams in the hearts, which are dull and sad<br />
Songs of light for the children of this world (The children)<br />
The children of this world (The children)</p>
<p>The children of this world (The children)<br />
The children of this world</p>
<p>Hope for those who are alone<br />
Who can&#8217;t see any way out anymore<br />
Songs of light for those who still stand in the shadow</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; power for the people, which resignate<br />
Love for those, who are losing their faith<br />
Songs of light for the children of this world</p>
<p>More flowers in the asphalt (The children)<br />
Emotions instead of violence (The children)<br />
A morning behind the horizon for all children of this world</p>
<p>More flowers in the asphalt (The children)<br />
Emotions instead of violence (The children)<br />
A morning behind the horizon for all children of this world</p>
