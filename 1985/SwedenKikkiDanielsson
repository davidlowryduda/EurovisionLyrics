Where have you been?<br />
I know that you existed, before I got to see you<br />
Of course there where others in my life<br />
But no one could offer me more than pastime</p>
<p>But today I feel something I&#8217;ve never felt<br />
I can see, that something has happened</p>
<p>You give me good vibrations<br />
Every time you take my hand in yours<br />
And every time you smile</p>
<p>I get good vibrations<br />
That can lead to something much more<br />
And I think love is on its way<br />
Taking big steps</p>
<p>We just met the other day<br />
But I have gotten used to have you around<br />
Even though you are more than just a friend<br />
It is too soon to call it love</p>
<p>And we have much left, now we&#8217;re only at the beginning<br />
But tonight, I know, that it&#8217;ll be you</p>
<p>Who give me good vibrations<br />
Every time you take my hand in yours<br />
And everytime you smile</p>
<p>I get good vibrations<br />
That can lead to something much more<br />
And I think love is on its way<br />
Taking big steps</p>
<p>That there might be problems I have learned<br />
If someone says &#8216;yes&#8217; too soon<br />
But it is actually quite hard to say no<br />
When you are the one that I want</p>
<p>You give me good vibrations<br />
Every time you take my hand in yours<br />
And every time you smile</p>
<p>I get good vibrations<br />
That can lead to something much more<br />
And I think love is on its way<br />
Taking big steps<br />
