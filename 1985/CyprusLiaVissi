Another day gone without a purpose<br />
I&#8217;m alone in empty time in this world<br />
In my bedroom, looking down again<br />
Only happiness, when thinking of the past</p>
<p>You finished like a melodious song<br />
You were a small musical piece<br />
Your scent stayed like a note on paper<br />
A living stamp of a loving moment</p>
<p>I loved you, I kept you in my life<br />
But you&#8217;re gone and loneliness breaks me<br />
I had a desire of locking you in my heart<br />
But it was wrong, I realised it too late</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll always remember you as a feast<br />
A loving and eternal icon<br />
A sweet memory you won&#8217;t vanish<br />
A secret hope you&#8217;ll be back</p>
<p>I loved you, I kept you in my life<br />
But you&#8217;re gone and loneliness breaks me<br />
I had a desire of locking you in my heart<br />
But it was wrong, I realised it too late</p>
<p>I had a desire of locking you in my heart<br />
But it was wrong, I realised it too late<br />
