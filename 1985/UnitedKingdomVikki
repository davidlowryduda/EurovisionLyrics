<p>It&#8217;s been a pleasant evening<br />
Now she says she&#8217;s leaving<br />
And he&#8217;s too proud to say out loud<br />
Oh baby, won&#8217;t you stay?</p>
<p>Now she says she&#8217;ll call him<br />
She finds herself fallin&#8217;<br />
When he reaches out and touches her hand<br />
She turns to walk away</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause there&#8217;s always a weak one, always a strong one<br />
Who&#8217;ll be the first to fall?</p>
<p>Love is the danger of meeting a stranger<br />
And takin&#8217; a chance on two hearts makin&#8217; it<br />
Love is the fire, the burnin&#8217; desire<br />
That makes the world go round</p>
<p>Love is the feelin&#8217; that makes you believe in<br />
Takin&#8217; a chance on two hearts beatin&#8217; as one<br />
That&#8217;s what love is</p>
<p>Still she&#8217;s hesitating<br />
Is the ice worth breaking?<br />
Should she hold back or rush right in<br />
Where angels fear to tread?</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause there&#8217;s always a weak one, always a strong one<br />
Who&#8217;ll be the first to fall?</p>
<p>Love is the danger of meeting a stranger<br />
And takin&#8217; a chance on two hearts makin&#8217; it<br />
Love is the fire, the burnin&#8217; desire<br />
That makes the world go round</p>
<p>Love is the feelin&#8217; that makes you believe in<br />
Takin&#8217; a chance on two hearts beatin&#8217; as one<br />
That&#8217;s what love is, hoh&#8230;</p>
<p>Love is the danger of meeting a stranger<br />
And takin&#8217; a chance on two hearts makin&#8217; it<br />
Love is the fire, the burnin&#8217; desire<br />
That makes the world go round</p>
<p>Love is the feelin&#8217; that makes you believe in<br />
