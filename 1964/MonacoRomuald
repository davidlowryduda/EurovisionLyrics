Where have they gone, those who made me believe<br />
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?<br />
So much time is spent in the vain expectation<br />
Of unsteady embraces, so much time is lost</p>
<p>The heart, overflowing with so much tenderness<br />
By my awkwardnesses kept its torment</p>
<p>On the street, tenderly, they took my hand<br />
A private conversation, seriously, they said tomorrow<br />
When I think of it today, however I smile of the time<br />
Of the past time, to believe in this story</p>
<p>Where have they gone, those who made me believe<br />
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?<br />
But that past time which seemed mad<br />
So much nostalgia it will be worth to me</p>
<p>Because the girls then had the mystery<br />
Of the first loves which are lost forever</p>
<p>Where have they gone, those who made me believe<br />
The lovely story of the forbidden fruit?<br />
