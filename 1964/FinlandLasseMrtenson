It&#8217;s another Sunday and he left his dungarees on the corner<br />
There&#8217;s no hurry at all, the alarm clock is silent too<br />
It&#8217;s Sunday morning and although a day lasts only a day<br />
You can get much of it, a satisfied song is sung</p>
<p>Time to walk on your own ways, lightened ways, lengthened ways<br />
To anywhere<br />
Time to think many things, unbelievable things, unknown things<br />
In any way<br />
He sings unasked:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another Sunday and although it&#8217;s soon Monday<br />
Hurry won&#8217;t pressure, idlers are singing</p>
<p>Time to be standing there and here, asking, holding<br />
The wall in its place<br />
Time to learn the rhythm of life, the style of life, the song of life<br />
Of the correct rhythm</p>
<p>You can get much of it, a satisfied song is sung<br />
Idlers are singing<br />
Hoy ee-yi-ee-yi-oo&#8230; hoy ee-yi-ee-yi-oo&#8230;<br />
Idlers are singing<br />
