Tell me again, Mallory, the song you sang to me<br />
Your summer song in the blue of the Irish sky<br />
You were only sixteen years old, I still was a child<br />
And the night that came took us for lovers</p>
<p>You, Mallory, you sang for me, the wind ruffled our hair<br />
And I don&#8217;t know anymore very well why we closed our eyes<br />
Remember, Mallory, we&#8217;ve waited for the day<br />
By dreaming, both of us, I really believe that it was love</p>
<p>Where is it, Mallory, the song you sang to me?<br />
Your summer song in the blue of the Irish sky<br />
The sun set, throwing gold in your eyes<br />
We acted that we loved each other, but for you it was just a game</p>
<p>Oh Mallory, where is that song, that summer love song?<br />
To which country did the wind go, the wind that carried it off?<br />
I&#8217;ll keep your song forever, Mallory<br />
Because it was the song, the song of a first love</p>
<p>Lalala lalala&#8230; lalalalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Because it was the song, the song of a first love<br />
