A strange man came from somewhere<br />
And gave me love and happiness<br />
I gave him my heart, a love began<br />
I saw only him and never looked back</p>
<p>How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And then you can&#8217;t get away from it anymore<br />
How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And when it&#8217;s over, the disappointment is great</p>
<p>Love, love, what a lovely game<br />
It never, never becomes too much for you</p>
<p>How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And then you can&#8217;t get away from it anymore<br />
How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And when it&#8217;s over, the disappointment is great</p>
<p>Faithfulness, faithfulness, what a big word<br />
Tears, tears, he left me alone</p>
<p>How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And then you can&#8217;t get away from it anymore<br />
How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And when it&#8217;s over, the disappointment is great</p>
<p>Love, love, what a lovely game<br />
It never, never becomes too much for you</p>
<p>How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And then you can&#8217;t get away from it anymore<br />
How quickly we get used to nice things<br />
And when it&#8217;s over, the disappointment is great<br />
