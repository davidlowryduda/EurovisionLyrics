<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I&#8217;ve always been looking in the time<br />
To give you better thoughts<br />
Looking in the sky, I was searching<br />
And up there, I&#8217;ve seen how to do it<br />
Therefore&#8230; therefore&#8230;</p>
<p>I confide my thoughts to a cloud<br />
That will bring them to you far away<br />
The wind will slowly push them<br />
Up above in the sky, into the endlessness</p>
<p>Perhaps star words are able to unite<br />
They&#8217;ll be golden letters written in the sky for you<br />
The sun will certainly make them shine<br />
So you will see them up there with me</p>
<p>I confide my thoughts to a cloud<br />
It will slowly, slowly arrive without making noise<br />
My love will reach you</p>
<p>I confide my thoughts to a cloud<br />
It will slowly, slowly arrive without making noise<br />
My love will reach you</p>
<p>The whole world will know what I&#8217;m thinking of you<br />
Those golden flocks are for you<br />
