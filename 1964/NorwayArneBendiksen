Life has finally taken shape, I feel good looking and cute<br />
Floating drunk with happiness around in a cornet beneath a pink balloon<br />
The world is all sun, the balloon is my symbol<br />
Oh, how I&#8217;m floating, oh, how I&#8217;m alive, bong</p>
<p>Humming a tune happily, going home from a successful ball<br />
The moon guides me smiling happily at me, my brain like an empty shell<br />
I simply exist on this road<br />
Dancing on while my thoughts spiral</p>
<p>Pull yourself together, my friend, where are the ideas going?<br />
To the point in the refrain that keeps returning</p>
<p>Life has finally taken shape, I feel good looking and cute<br />
Floating drunk with happiness around in a cornet beneath a pink balloon<br />
The world is all sun, the balloon is my symbol<br />
Oh, how I&#8217;m floating, oh, how I&#8217;m alive, bong</p>
<p>Life has finally taken shape, I feel good looking and cute<br />
Floating drunk with happiness, around in a cornet beneath a pink balloon<br />
The world is all sun, the balloon is my symbol<br />
Oh, how I&#8217;m floating, oh, how I&#8217;m alive, bong, bong, bong, bong<br />
Oh, how I&#8217;m floating, oh, how I&#8217;m alive, bong</p>
<p>Bong<br />
