The song about you is never over<br />
It wakes up happy, when the day starts<br />
It is like a soft, gentle melody<br />
To me humming</p>
<p>A thousand things from far or near<br />
Sending me word with tempting voices:<br />
You alone is the one that I love<br />
Never forgetting</p>
<p>Hope can burst<br />
And people disappoint me bitterly<br />
But the song, that I still have<br />
It lights a candle for my spirits again</p>
<p>The song about you, the melody of my life<br />
Humming about everything, that you have given me<br />
The song about you is never over<br />
For to me, you are the entire life</p>
<p>The poets write so many times<br />
About the power of love<br />
But even the most wonderful songs<br />
Don&#8217;t get everything said</p>
<p>What is sorrow or joy<br />
Lives in the deepest of the hearts<br />
Whether I&#8217;ll laugh or cry<br />
I&#8217;ll be hearing a song without words</p>
<p>The song about you, the melody of my life<br />
Humming about everything, that you have given me<br />
The song about you is never over<br />
For to me, you are the entire life<br />
