The girls are pretty once spring is here<br />
But the vows forget themselves once spring goes away<br />
There in the prairie, I always await but in vain<br />
A girl in organdy once spring returns</p>
<p>I think again about her eyes once spring is here<br />
I see again our parting, once spring goes away<br />
And her image hanging around the corner of my path<br />
When the evenings become warm once spring returns</p>
<p>No, time can&#8217;t do anything<br />
No, it is not up to time</p>
<p>I believe I will find her once spring is here<br />
I cease to dream about it once spring goes away<br />
After many winters yet my heart remembers<br />
As if it was yesterday once spring returns</p>
<p>No, time can&#8217;t do anything<br />
Oh no, it is not up to time</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to die once spring is here<br />
I always believe to be healed once spring goes away<br />
But I feel the sting of a pain that embraces me<br />
Like an old wound once spring returns</p>
<p>Once spring returns<br />
Once spring returns<br />
Once spring returns<br />
Once spring returns<br />
