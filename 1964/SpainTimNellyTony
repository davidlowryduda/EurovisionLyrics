The voice of the sea prisoner<br />
Is kept in the conch<br />
So your voice didn&#8217;t flee<br />
My heart enclosed it</p>
<p>I love you, how much I love you<br />
The echo repeated me</p>
<p>Why, between sky and sea<br />
Between shadow and light, did I see your eyes?<br />
Why did I suddenly feel<br />
That day sinking in my heart?</p>
<p>Why did you save me<br />
And did the sea give it to you when the wave came?<br />
Why did your love invade<br />
My beach which yesterday was so lonely?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how your voice changed<br />
My heart into your conch</p>
<p>Why did you save me<br />
And did the sea give it to you when the wave came?<br />
Why did your love invade<br />
My beach which yesterday was so lonely?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how your voice changed<br />
My heart into your conch<br />
Of love, of love<br />
