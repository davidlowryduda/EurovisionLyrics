<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Nearby my river, with silver reflections<br />
Between heaven and earth, we loved each other much<br />
In the light grass we forgot our oath<br />
Nearby my river, with silver fishes</p>
<p>There, the world was so far away<br />
There, there was nothing left<br />
Nothing but my eyes in your eyes<br />
Nothing, nothing but the both of us</p>
<p>Nearby my river, with silver reflections<br />
Between heaven and earth, we loved each other much</p>
<p>The river is flowing and the time is flowing away<br />
Sad and solitary, I&#8217;m coming now</p>
<p>Nearby my river, where we loved each other much<br />
Nearby my river, where we loved each other much<br />
