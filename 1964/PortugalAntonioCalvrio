God, at your feet I confess<br />
God, I hurted my love<br />
God, I ask for your forgiveness, but I don&#8217;t deserve it<br />
God, I despised my love and sinned</p>
<p>Pardon me, I beg You<br />
God, You are redemption<br />
I know I lost her, but I love her, so I cry<br />
God, asking for her forgiveness</p>
<p>God, I confess the perjury of so many promises<br />
God, I made some mistakes, but in life I found a lesson<br />
God, I beg You, God<br />
Oh my God, don&#8217;t forget my prayer<br />
God, oh endless kindness, give me your forgiveness</p>
<p>Love, I had never found love in life<br />
It&#8217;s late, I walk through life, lost in pain<br />
God, this love is more precious than the rarest jewels<br />
It&#8217;s the most precious one of loves<br />
God, if love is a punishment, forgive me, my God<br />
