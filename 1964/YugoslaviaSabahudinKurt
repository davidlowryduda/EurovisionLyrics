<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
There is no escape anymore<br />
The world has closed the circle<br />
So may the plant and the bird<br />
Be like a human, like a friend</p>
<p>And if I became a branch<br />
My leaves would ponder<br />
Oh, and the red gold would not<br />
Teem only in the autumn</p>
<p>If I turned into stone<br />
I would not be forgotten<br />
I would be the only one on the shore<br />
A thinking, blue stone</p>
<p>There is no escape anymore<br />
Life has come full circle<br />
So may the hill and the dusk<br />
Be like a human, like a friend</p>
<p>If I turned into stone<br />
I would not be forgotten<br />
I would be the only one on the shore<br />
A thinking, blue stone</p>
<p>There is no escape anymore<br />
Life has come full circle<br />
So may the hill and the dusk<br />
Be like a human, like a friend<br />
