Only why, why everything has to pass by?<br />
Oh&#8230; only why, why nothing stays forever?<br />
You leave me, you don&#8217;t turn your head back<br />
Give me the answer &#8211; only why, why?</p>
<p>Only why, why the flowers bloom so beautiful<br />
Oh&#8230; when will they fade and die?<br />
A dream escapes, the time is up<br />
Please, give me the answer &#8211; only why, why?</p>
<p>Often I hear your words: I will be yours in eternity<br />
I believed you, but it just was a pretence</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; only why, why should everything be like this?<br />
Oh&#8230; only why, why am I so alone now?<br />
Before you leave me, turn your head back<br />
And then give me the answer &#8211; only why, why?<br />
Why? Why?<br />
