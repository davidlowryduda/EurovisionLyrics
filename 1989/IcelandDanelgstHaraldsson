Light up my path<br />
Lustful old moon<br />
Though the road seems clear<br />
There are things the eye can&#8217;t see</p>
<p>The world is full<br />
Of people seeking happiness<br />
That glows like gold<br />
In the light from the moon</p>
<p>Look back into my eyes<br />
Look back, I wait for you<br />
Look back into my eyes<br />
And you can see what no one sees</p>
<p>Everyone desires<br />
Something they keep to themselves<br />
I intend if I may<br />
To have a secret with you</p>
<p>Light up my path<br />
Oh, you lustful old moon<br />
Though the road seems clear<br />
There are things the eye can&#8217;t see</p>
<p>Look back into my eyes<br />
Look back, I wait for you<br />
Look back into my eyes<br />
And you will see what no one sees</p>
<p>Look back into my eyes<br />
Look back, I wait for you<br />
Look back into my eyes<br />
And you will see what no one sees<br />
