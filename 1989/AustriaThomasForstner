<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
To make the sun shine again tomorrow<br />
And to make tears only be for laughter<br />
For every child to have hope inside<br />
For a life without war and fear<br />
For this reason it&#8217;s good to be a dreamer</p>
<p>I&#8217;m singing just a song tonight<br />
A song to make friends<br />
I&#8217;m singing just a song and I know<br />
That with every word the ice breaks</p>
<p>So that nobody will have to standing alone in the darkness<br />
And love returns to the earth<br />
To let every human being live in freedom<br />
And turn guns into flowers sometime<br />
For this reason it&#8217;s good to be a dreamer</p>
<p>I&#8217;m singing just a song tonight<br />
A song to make friends<br />
I&#8217;m singing just a song and I know<br />
That with every word the ice breaks</p>
<p>I&#8217;m singing just a song tonight<br />
A song that does like fire<br />
I&#8217;m singing it for you and me<br />
And for the whole world<br />
</div>
