You seek out my thoughts, I know what you will say<br />
But if you told me what you know, the silence would remain</p>
<p>When the closeness of friends has become a threat<br />
And smiles of hope are erased<br />
Then come and wake me up, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Then you&#8217;ll remain mine, you are my friend</p>
<p>I know you are small, but still very big<br />
You want to embrace the whole world, I greet you, brother</p>
<p>When the closeness of friends has become a threat<br />
And smiles of hope are erased<br />
Then come and wake me, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Then you&#8217;ll remain mine, you are my friend</p>
<p>(Your voice has reached me, and I let you in)<br />
For there is room for us both, for thoughts and minds</p>
<p>When the closeness of friends has become a threat<br />
And smiles of hope are erased<br />
Then come and wake me, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Then you&#8217;ll remain mine, you are my friend<br />
