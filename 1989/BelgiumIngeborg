Through the wind, through the rain<br />
Straight through, through everything</p>
<p>I see you in front of me, with my eyes closed<br />
I can feel you, with my heart locked up<br />
I hear you talking, but you aren&#8217;t there<br />
You aren&#8217;t there</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d feel lost if I have to lose you<br />
And I keep dreaming of you because I can&#8217;t miss you<br />
I can&#8217;t miss you</p>
<p>Through the wind, through the rain<br />
Straight through everything<br />
Through the storm, even if it&#8217;s not going my way<br />
Because of you, I&#8217;m never alone</p>
<p>I feel you by my side<br />
When I want to forget at night on the street<br />
What&#8217;s written in my eyes<br />
If you only knew</p>
<p>And I want to get lost in a winner&#8217;s ecstasy<br />
And I&#8217;d like to scream but I can only sing<br />
I can only sing</p>
<p>Through the wind (through the wind), through the rain<br />
Straight through everything<br />
Through the storm (through the storm), even if it&#8217;s not going my way<br />
Because of you, I&#8217;m never alone</p>
<p>Through an endless distance<br />
Through a wall of emptiness<br />
Through a land of silence<br />
Through a wall of emptiness</p>
<p>Through the wind (through the wind), through the rain<br />
Straight through everything<br />
Through the storm (through the storm), even if it&#8217;s not going my way<br />
Because of you, I&#8217;m never alone</p>
<p>Never alone<br />
Because of you, I&#8217;m never alone<br />
