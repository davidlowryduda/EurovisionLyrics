There are moments that fear and doubt win you<br />
The world seems hostile and the night impassable and cold</p>
<p>But in the evening sky, search and find your own star<br />
Because the shadows in the first light seem to be childish phobias<br />
But in the evening sky, search and find your own star<br />
Because the shadows in the first light seem to be childish phobias</p>
<p>There are moments that you feel you&#8217;ll never manage it<br />
You feel unimportant and small, you don&#8217;t know where you go and who you are</p>
<p>But in the evening sky, search and find your own star<br />
Because the shadows in the first light seem to be childish phobias<br />
But in the evening sky, search and find your own star<br />
Because the shadows in the first light seem to be childish phobias</p>
<p>Make a secret garden, find courage and enthusiasm<br />
Life smiles to anyone who has faith and stamina<br />
Make a secret garden, find courage and enthusiasm<br />
Life smiles to anyone who has faith and stamina</p>
<p>But in the evening sky, search and find your own star<br />
