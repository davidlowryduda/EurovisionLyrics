The last chord of my childhood&#8217;s song<br />
Keeps on playing in the horizon<br />
I won&#8217;t see the figure of the angel painting<br />
By my side to protect me anymore</p>
<p>Yet over a thousand winds<br />
I can hear a carefree song playing<br />
And with it can sing a happy one:<br />
The child of summer and sun</p>
<p>The good life, it has all been so sweet<br />
The good life, no need for tears</p>
<p>I was just quenching life&#8217;s thirst<br />
I knew how to plead for happiness<br />
After everything all I can say is:<br />
The good life</p>
<p>Sometimes my mind is filled<br />
With yearning to be with the white angels<br />
When the rainbow bends in the sky<br />
And I can&#8217;t find my way to the bottom of it</p>
<p>But when the ribbon of the moments goes on<br />
There&#8217;s an unbroken peace in the soul<br />
And to you can sing a happy one:<br />
The child of summer and sun</p>
<p>The good life, it has all been so sweet<br />
The good life, no need for tears</p>
<p>I was just quenching life&#8217;s thirst<br />
I knew how to plead for happiness<br />
After everything all I can say is:<br />
The good life</p>
<p>The good life, it has all been so sweet<br />
The good life, no need for tears</p>
<p>I was just quenching life&#8217;s thirst<br />
I knew how to plead for happiness<br />
After everything all I can say is:<br />
The good life, the good life<br />
