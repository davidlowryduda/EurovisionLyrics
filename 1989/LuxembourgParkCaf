He likes the production, the big tunes<br />
The star of the serie noire, one hell of a world<br />
He plays the roles, with a cartoon atmosphere<br />
In front of the camera &#8211; what cinema</p>
<p>Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)</p>
<p>Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)</p>
<p>His script and his screenplay are self indulgent<br />
The star of the big screen, but not for long</p>
<p>Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; but I love him and I believe<br />
Ooh&#8230; that I&#8217;m his star</p>
<p>Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)</p>
<p>Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
He squats in Hollywood (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
Mister lives in a dream (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
In an imaginary world (He lives in Tooneland)<br />
