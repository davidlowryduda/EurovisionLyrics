<p>No more sad songs for me to sing<br />
No more heartaches for you to bring me<br />
No more being the hurting kind<br />
I am running where you won&#8217;t find me</p>
<p>Whenever I was lonely<br />
I&#8217;d call you up and then<br />
I would soon regret my momentary weakness<br />
But it feels so strong, why do I always get it wrong?</p>
<p>No more sad songs on lonely nights<br />
No more seeking the wrongs or rights of it<br />
No more playing the fool for you<br />
You can do what you wanna do now</p>
<p>Whenever I was lonely<br />
I&#8217;d call you up and then<br />
I would soon regret my momentary weakness<br />
But it feels so strong, why do I always get it wrong?</p>
<p>(No more sad songs, no more heartache)<br />
(I am running where you can&#8217;t find me)</p>
<p>No more sad songs for me to sing<br />
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)<br />
No more heartaches, no more heartaches<br />
So now you can&#8217;t hurt me<br />
(I am running where you can&#8217;t find me)</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish that we had never met<br />
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re my weakness, you&#8217;re my weakness<br />
You&#8217;re my one and only regret<br />
(I am running where you can&#8217;t find me)</p>
<p>I am runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217; where you won&#8217;t find me<br />
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)<br />
Don&#8217;t wanna play the fool for you<br />
(I am running where you can&#8217;t find me)<br />
So go on your way, do what you gotta do</p>
<p>(No more sad songs, no more heartache)<br />
(I am running where you can&#8217;t find me)<br />
(No more sad songs, no more heartache)<br />
(I am running where you can&#8217;t find me)</p>
