It was a new world, a poet&#8217;s dream<br />
To go far away, singing new victories</p>
<p>And to raise flags proudly<br />
To live warrior adventures<br />
A thousand epic poems, life is so full<br />
There were oceans of love</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau<br />
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macau<br />
Oh, I&#8217;ve been to Timor<br />
I&#8217;ve been a conqueror</p>
<p>A whole nation guided by the skies<br />
Spread around the world, following their heroes</p>
<p>And they brought the light of culture<br />
They made tender seeds grow<br />
A thousand epic poems, life is so full<br />
There were oceans of love</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau<br />
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macau<br />
Oh, I&#8217;ve been to Timor<br />
I&#8217;ve been a conqueror</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau<br />
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macau<br />
Oh, I&#8217;ve been to Timor<br />
I&#8217;ve been a conqueror</p>
<p>Days after days, months and years on the sea<br />
Following a trail of stars to conquer</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau<br />
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macau<br />
Oh, I&#8217;ve been to Timor<br />
I&#8217;ve been a conqueror</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to Brazil, Praia and Bissau<br />
Angola, Mozambique, Goa and Macau<br />
Oh, I&#8217;ve been to Timor<br />
I&#8217;ve been a conqueror</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a conqueror, I&#8217;ve been a conqueror, I&#8217;ve been a conqueror<br />
