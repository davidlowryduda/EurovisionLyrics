You and me, we flew so high<br />
It was not a long time ago<br />
An airplane full of young dreams<br />
Was ready for us</p>
<p>The two of us, it was so great<br />
We conquered the sky<br />
Why did you let me go<br />
Without a parachute in the night?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never totally forgotten the time<br />
When we were flyers<br />
You haven&#8217;t left my heart<br />
I only think about it</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve often told me: &#8220;We&#8217;re strong, both of us&#8221;<br />
Something like that couldn&#8217;t pass away like this<br />
I&#8217;ve never totally forgotten the time<br />
When we were flyers</p>
<p>I would like to do it again with you<br />
Such a flight into the evening glow<br />
I would like to risk my heart once again<br />
Even if it killed me</p>
<p>The two of us, it was so great<br />
Something like this is rare<br />
Will we once again<br />
Lose ourselves in the clouds?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never totally forgotten the time<br />
When we were flyers<br />
You haven&#8217;t left my heart<br />
I only think about it</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve often told me: &#8220;We&#8217;re strong, both of us&#8221;<br />
Something like that couldn&#8217;t pass away like this</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never totally forgotten the time<br />
When we were flyers<br />
You haven&#8217;t left my heart<br />
I only think about it<br />
