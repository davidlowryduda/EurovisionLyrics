You&#8217;re a bit down in the mouth, do you think everything&#8217;s all grey?<br />
Yes, I know how it is, of course, you know it<br />
But forget it for a second, let it disappear into the air<br />
Grab your palette, because now we&#8217;ll put on the colours</p>
<p>We&#8217;re painting the town red and the sky white of star gleam<br />
All that is grey and boring gets an extra patch of colour<br />
Then we give the clothes of night a brush-stroke or more<br />
And only when the sun says good morning and gets to work<br />
We&#8217;ll say goodnight</p>
<p>The glasses you&#8217;re wearing can colour the things that happen<br />
So you don&#8217;t see the joys others see<br />
But you can borrow mine for a couple of hours if you like<br />
Have a look around, open your eyes, come out and hammer away</p>
<p>We&#8217;re painting the town red and the sky white of star gleam<br />
All that is grey and boring gets an extra patch of colour<br />
Then we give the clothes of night a brush-stroke or more<br />
And only when the sun says good morning and gets to work<br />
We&#8217;ll say goodnight</p>
<p>Are you still sitting inside<br />
Rolling down the blinds<br />
The joys have to be found<br />
Just keep at it and come along<br />
(Just keep at it and come along)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re painting the town red and the sky white of star gleam<br />
All that is grey and boring gets an extra patch of colour<br />
Then we give the clothes of night a brush-stroke or more<br />
And only when the sun says good morning and gets to work</p>
<p>Yes, only when the sun says good morning and gets to work<br />
We&#8217;ll say goodnight<br />
