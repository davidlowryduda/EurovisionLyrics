<p>I call my baby and she tells me that she&#8217;s leavin&#8217;<br />
And this time it&#8217;s for good<br />
I can&#8217;t believe her and I&#8217;m sure that there is something<br />
That I&#8217;ve misunderstood, yeah yeah</p>
<p>When she&#8217;s gone, I&#8217;ll be standin&#8217; here in the rain<br />
When she&#8217;s gone, well, the sun won&#8217;t shine anyway</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you see that it&#8217;s the real me?<br />
Take me as I am or let me be<br />
Come to me, discover me<br />
Oh, take my hand and you will see it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>You know the feeling when you&#8217;re needing<br />
And your heart is cold<br />
If there&#8217;s a reason or a meaning<br />
Then I ain&#8217;t been told, yeah yeah</p>
<p>When she&#8217;s gone, I&#8217;ll be standin&#8217; here in the rain<br />
When she&#8217;s gone, well, the sun won&#8217;t shine anyway</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you see that it&#8217;s the real me?<br />
Take me as I am or let me be<br />
Come to me, discover me<br />
Oh, take my hand and you will see it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>Real me, it&#8217;s the real me<br />
Real me, it&#8217;s the real me</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you see that it&#8217;s the real me?<br />
Take me as I am or let me be<br />
Come to me, discover me<br />
Oh, take my hand and you will see it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; can&#8217;t you see that it&#8217;s the real me?<br />
Take me as I am or let me be<br />
Come to me, discover me<br />
Oh, take my hand and you will see it&#8217;s me</p>
