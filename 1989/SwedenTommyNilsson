One day, when the winds carry<br />
One day, you and I are standing there<br />
One day, when the dream reaches out<br />
When our roads meet, we will understand each other</p>
<p>One day, we all understand<br />
One day, when silence rules<br />
One day, I find your hand<br />
When our roads meet, we will understand each other</p>
<p>We carry a yearning, and wander around<br />
Wander without seeing<br />
Whatever happens, I will come to you<br />
Stay even though it&#8217;s late<br />
Stay even though it&#8217;s late</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; one day, when the winds carry<br />
One day, you and I are standing there<br />
One day, when the dream reaches out<br />
When our roads meet, we will understand each other</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; everything we&#8217;re looking for, is right here<br />
Everything we hope for will happen<br />
Oh&#8230; whatever happens, I will come to you<br />
Stay even though it&#8217;s late<br />
Oh&#8230; stay even though it&#8217;s late</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; one day, when the winds carry<br />
One day, you and I are standing there</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; one day<br />
When our roads meet, we will understand each other</p>
<p>One day, we all understand<br />
Oh&#8230; one day, when silence rules<br />
One day, I find your hand<br />
When our roads meet, we will understand each other</p>
<p>(One day, when the winds carry)<br />
One day, you and I are standing there<br />
One day, when the dream reaches out<br />
When our roads meet, we will understand each other<br />
