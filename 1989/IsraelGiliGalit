<p>The morning dew has saturated me and before me lies a king&#8217;s road<br />
A harp and a crown have attached me to a Song of Degrees<br />
Still my thoughts confound me and a caress of a ray of sun<br />
My train of thought has suddenly been cut off</p>
<p>I gaze, my horse is beautiful<br />
He carries me on his back to the king&#8217;s road</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s road is the only road for me<br />
The king&#8217;s harp is my song<br />
The king&#8217;s road is a dream to me, is a riddle to me<br />
The king&#8217;s harp, my only love</p>
<p>A day that is born with dawn like a cycle in nature<br />
(A day that is born with dawn)<br />
Comes and grows and suddenly dies silently</p>
<p>And in me is created (And in me is created)<br />
A marvellous golden tune (A golden tune)<br />
Then shall I carry a prayer to the universe</p>
<p>I gaze &#8211; my horse is beautiful<br />
He carries me on his back to the king&#8217;s road</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s road is the only road for me<br />
The king&#8217;s harp is my song<br />
The king&#8217;s road is a dream to me, is a riddle to me<br />
The king&#8217;s harp, my only love</p>
<p>I gaze, my horse is beautiful<br />
He carries me on his back to the king&#8217;s road<br />
(The king&#8217;s road)</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s road (Is the only road for me)<br />
Is the only road for me (Is the road for me)<br />
The king&#8217;s harp (Is my song)<br />
Is my song</p>
<p>The king&#8217;s road (Is a dream to me)<br />
Is a dream to me, is a riddle to me (Is a riddle to me)<br />
The king&#8217;s harp (My only love)<br />
My only love<br />
