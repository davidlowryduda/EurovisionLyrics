I couldn&#8217;t tell you my age<br />
I couldn&#8217;t write my name<br />
I grew up as a wild nettle<br />
On patches of tar</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where the images<br />
That stick to my eyes are coming from<br />
Nor where this desire<br />
To sing what I want is rising from</p>
<p>I stole life &#8211; yes, I admit it<br />
I no longer know who or where<br />
I ran away pulling funny noses at nothing</p>
<p>I stole life without any regret<br />
From two shadows that passed by<br />
But I have kept my ray of sunshine</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I look like<br />
I don&#8217;t know who I&#8217;m going to<br />
But from my castles made of ashes<br />
I feel the fire come to life again</p>
<p>I feel my eyes lighting up<br />
Someone will send me away from the day<br />
That I arrive at the border<br />
Which separates me from love</p>
<p>I stole life &#8211; yes, I admit it<br />
I no longer know who or where<br />
I ran away pulling funny noses at nothing</p>
<p>I stole life without any regret<br />
From two shadows that passed by<br />
But I have kept my ray of sunshine</p>
<p>I stole life &#8211; yes, I admit it<br />
I no longer know who or where<br />
I ran away pulling funny noses at nothing</p>
<p>I stole life without any regret<br />
From two shadows that passed by<br />
But I have kept my ray of sunshine<br />
