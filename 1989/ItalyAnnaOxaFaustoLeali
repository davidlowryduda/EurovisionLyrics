I would&#8217;ve wanted to talk to you<br />
To convince you you&#8217;d better be serious<br />
You, who played with my heart and with your words</p>
<p>So much wasted time, trying to explain you<br />
That I really loved you<br />
We didn&#8217;t found each other, we didn&#8217;t look for each other<br />
We were never lost, lost</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve wanted to look at you<br />
And intuit all your desires<br />
Give you a sigh, if only from a distance</p>
<p>Because I was afraid you could see it<br />
Like a lamp in your eyes, a sincere love<br />
The anger wraps itself like a paper plane<br />
When it meets the wall</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve wanted more<br />
I would&#8217;ve wanted you too</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve wanted to tie you<br />
To be able to look at you every day<br />
To change the route, the road of our destiny</p>
<p>And stick you to my breast, so that I don&#8217;t let you go<br />
To a life which flies away<br />
The heart stops for a while<br />
In those winter days and the ice will melt</p>
<p>And the ice will melt<br />
And the ice will melt</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve wanted to follow you<br />
But pride is never fast<br />
It&#8217;s just a pretext to cover a mistake</p>
<p>Even when I found out that it was our tomorrow<br />
That wanted to conclude peace<br />
The wrinkle on my face that you called &#8216;expression&#8217;<br />
Is now the soil of a river</p>
<p>How many nights to think?<br />
How many bitter tears have wet my soul?</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve wanted more<br />
I would&#8217;ve wanted more<br />
I would&#8217;ve wanted more<br />
I would&#8217;ve wanted you too<br />
