Look at your life, what&#8217;s it been like?<br />
Years, they&#8217;re just going round in circles<br />
You want to change yourself<br />
But nobody breaks the ice, ooh&#8230;</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;re talking to people who mean nothing to you<br />
Look, they&#8217;re feeling just the same as you<br />
But there are still roads which lead directly to me<br />
Oh baby</p>
<p>A song can be a bridge<br />
And each tone is like a stone<br />
Making it strong and stable<br />
You can walk over it, understand the others</p>
<p>A song can be a bridge<br />
Have a little courage and sing along<br />
And if your heart is ready<br />
Come over this bridge, away from your loneliness</p>
<p>Stop playing and learn how to feel<br />
How many people are friends<br />
Learn how to sing, trust just like a child<br />
Oh baby</p>
<p>A song can be a bridge<br />
And each tone is like a stone<br />
Making it strong and stable<br />
You can walk over it, understand the others</p>
<p>A song can be a bridge<br />
Have a little courage and sing along<br />
And if your heart is ready<br />
Come over this bridge, away from your loneliness</p>
<p>(Nananana nananana&#8230;)<br />
(Nananana nananana&#8230;)<br />
(Nana nana nana&#8230;)</p>
