<p>You came along and touched my life with summertime<br />
And filled my soul with rays of golden sunshine<br />
You made me feel that somethin&#8217; real was waiting to be found<br />
Changing my whole style, teaching me to smile</p>
<p>Every day, every way, let me stay in your summer<br />
Summer, stay with me<br />
Keep me warm, summer wine<br />
Keep me warm, summertime</p>
<p>I feel the warmth of summer deep inside of me<br />
And know the glow of love will show and free me<br />
And when you&#8217;re gone, I&#8217;ll carry on with what you left in me<br />
Something that will grow, everyone will know</p>
<p>Every day, every way, let me stay in your summer<br />
Summer, stay with me<br />
Keep me warm, summer wine<br />
Keep me warm, summertime</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll be returning when next summer comes<br />
Then we&#8217;ll be three, together in the summer sun</p>
