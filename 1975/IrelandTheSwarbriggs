<p>When you&#8217;re lonely, when you&#8217;re blue<br />
When you need someone to talk to, when you need a talkin&#8217; to<br />
And when troubles full and plenty come pilin&#8217; at your door<br />
That&#8217;s what friends are for</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the whole wide world<br />
If every now and then a single voice was heard<br />
Telling it like it should be, makin&#8217; it simple and plain<br />
If that man needs a helpin&#8217; hand, help him in from the rain</p>
<p>Now I know you, know you well<br />
And I know that you&#8217;ve been worryin&#8217;, it&#8217;s not hard for me to tell<br />
But I&#8217;m standin&#8217; right beside you, of that you can be sure<br />
That&#8217;s what friends are for</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the whole wide world<br />
If every now and then a single voice was heard<br />
Telling it like it should be, makin&#8217; it simple and plain<br />
If that man needs a helpin&#8217; hand, help him in from the rain</p>
<p>So remember, take your time<br />
Just be sure and let it harmonise, yeah be sure and let it rhyme<br />
I might call on you to see me through, so open up your door<br />
That&#8217;s what friends are for<br />
That&#8217;s what friends are for</p>
