<p>If things shouldn&#8217;t go right<br />
Your stars are not twinkling so bright<br />
Don&#8217;t cry, for what&#8217;s the use<br />
To be counting your blues?</p>
<p>Just say you had a date<br />
And your friend turned out to be late<br />
Cheer up, think it&#8217;s a boon<br />
Go on, whistle a tune</p>
<p>Nothing will change what had to be done<br />
It just happened to be<br />
Pack your troubles and make fun<br />
You&#8217;ll enjoy it, you&#8217;ll see</p>
<p>So do listen to me<br />
Whatever your trouble may be<br />
Join in and come along<br />
With a smile and a song</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to understand<br />
That the world is not at its end<br />
Forget what beats you inside<br />
Keep it out of your mind</p>
<p>Nothing will change what had to be done<br />
It just happened to be<br />
Pack your troubles and make fun<br />
You&#8217;ll enjoy it, you&#8217;ll see</p>
<p>Sure love not to be hurt<br />
We were born to live on this Earth<br />
So when something goes wrong<br />
Join in singing this song</p>
<p>Sure love not to be hurt<br />
We were born to live on this Earth<br />
So when something goes wrong<br />
Join in singing this song</p>
<p>Join in singing this song</p>
