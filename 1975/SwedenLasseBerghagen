<p>I know that tonight you&#8217;re alone<br />
In your room with a note in your hand<br />
In your dreams you&#8217;re regretting, but never forgetting<br />
That often you doubt where you stand</p>
<p>Your phonograph spins out of tune<br />
You see pictures in your memory<br />
I know that you&#8217;re crying, but there&#8217;s no denying<br />
That time has a different melody</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Can&#8217;t you see the world is yours?<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Life has still so much in store to give you</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
You must change your tune somehow<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Live your life and live it now</p>
<p>You long for the world that you loved<br />
And you want to be there once again<br />
But your diary&#8217;s confessions are like signs that the ocean<br />
Erased forever from the sand</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Can&#8217;t you see the world is yours?<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Life has still so much in store to give you</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
You must change your tune somehow<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Live your life and live it now</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Can&#8217;t you see the world is yours?<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Life has still so much in store to give you</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
You must change your tune somehow<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Live your life and live it now</p>
<p>Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Can&#8217;t you see the world is yours?<br />
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie, Jennie<br />
Life has still so much in store</p>
