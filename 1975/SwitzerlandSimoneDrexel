An old man was sitting mutely at the side of the road<br />
In all the noise and traffic<br />
A child just threw a coin at him<br />
He called him back</p>
<p>Then he showed him a game of mikado<br />
A bundle of sticks, multi-coloured and long<br />
He threw them to a small circle<br />
Softly singing</p>
<p>Mikado, mikado, that&#8217;s how the old game is called<br />
Mikado, mikado, not everyone reaches the goal<br />
You can get everything with some skill<br />
Mikado, mikado, only trust your luck</p>
<p>Mikado, mikado, that&#8217;s how the old game is called<br />
Mikado, mikado, never show a feeling<br />
When something doesn&#8217;t concern you, don&#8217;t touch it<br />
Mikado, mikado, is now played by everyone</p>
<p>The old man said to the child in front of him:<br />
&#8220;Look at this, I&#8217;m taking a stick away&#8221;<br />
&#8220;They remain completely unaffected&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Those other sticks over there&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the rule, and listen to me now&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What a child can learn from this&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When you make just one mistake&#8221;<br />
&#8220;The next will follow&#8221;</p>
<p>Mikado, mikado, that&#8217;s how the old game is called<br />
Mikado, mikado, not everyone reaches the goal<br />
You can get everything with some skill<br />
Mikado, mikado, only trust your luck</p>
<p>Mikado, mikado, that&#8217;s how the old game is called<br />
Mikado, mikado, never show a feeling<br />
When something doesn&#8217;t concern you, don&#8217;t touch it<br />
Mikado, mikado, is now played by everyone<br />
