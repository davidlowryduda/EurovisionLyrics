<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I fell asleep, listening to your voice<br />
Forgetting my life in your niche, in your niche<br />
I woke up, I have found your voice back<br />
And I knew how to love, tell me why, tell me why</p>
<p>You are my only love, you&#8217;re my existence<br />
You have given me love, you have given me the chance<br />
To understand today that I lived for you<br />
To know that my life doesn&#8217;t exist without you</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re going to steal the memories of my childhood<br />
Let me keep them just the time, just the time<br />
To see again my adolescence, running in the forests<br />
And letting the wind singing for you, singing for you</p>
<p>You are my only love, you&#8217;re my existence<br />
You gave me love, you gave me the chance<br />
To understand today that I lived for you<br />
To know that my life doesn&#8217;t exist without you<br />
