<p>When you feelin&#8217; all right, everything is up-tight<br />
Try to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong<br />
There will be no sorrow when you sing tomorrow<br />
And you walk along with your ding-dang-dong</p>
<p>Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it&#8217;s a big hit<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Sing ding-ding-dong</p>
<p>When you feelin&#8217; all right, everything is up-tight<br />
Listen to a song that goes ding ding-a-dong<br />
And the world looks sunny, everyone is funny<br />
When they sing a song that goes ding-dang-dong</p>
<p>Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it&#8217;s a big hit<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Sing ding-ding-dong</p>
<p>(Ding-dang-dong, ding-a-dang-dong)<br />
When you think it&#8217;s all over, they let me down<br />
Dry your tears and forget all your sorrow<br />
Try to smile while you say goodbye</p>
<p>(Ding-dong ding-dong)<br />
Ding-dang-dong when you&#8217;ll wake up tomorrow<br />
When the sun is up in the sky</p>
<p>When you feelin&#8217; all right, everything is up-tight<br />
Try to sing a song that goes ding ding-a-dong<br />
There will be no sorrow when you&#8217;ll sing tomorrow<br />
And you walk along with your ding-dang-dong</p>
<p>Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it&#8217;s a big hit<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone</p>
<p>Ding-a-dong every hour, when you pick a flower<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Ding-a-dong, listen to it, maybe it&#8217;s a big hit<br />
Even when your lover is gone, gone, gone<br />
Sing ding-ding-dong</p>
