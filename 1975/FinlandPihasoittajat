<p>The door opens wide &#8211; every head turns round to stare<br />
He steps inside with raindrops on his hair<br />
A grey old man with legs a-limping, he finds himself a chair<br />
Then he lifts a fiddle and bow with gentle care</p>
<p>And just like sunlight out of the rain, old man fiddle&#8217;s come to play again<br />
And light this night up into flame<br />
Just his dancing fiddling bow brings to life all sleepy toes<br />
In this old heart till morning glows</p>
<p>So kiss the blues goodbye<br />
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly<br />
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie<br />
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try</p>
<p>We sang along into the dawn till our cares were just memories<br />
Danced in time to country tunes<br />
In some valley he lives free, where his notes ripen on the trees<br />
Underneath the harvest moon</p>
<p>So kiss the blues goodbye<br />
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly<br />
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie<br />
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try</p>
<p>In the gentle falling rain, you could still hear the loving sound<br />
That filled the night with memories<br />
And when the skies are turning grey, bring him back here to play again<br />
He&#8217;ll waken blossoms on the trees</p>
<p>So kiss the blues goodbye<br />
Let the mountain melody brighten the night and make the good times fly<br />
Feet are dancing free in ragtime reverie<br />
Pick up your lazy legs and give it a try</p>
