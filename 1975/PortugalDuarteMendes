From those who died without knowing why<br />
From those who persevered in silence and in cold<br />
From the strength born in fear<br />
And rage liberated in the early morning<br />
The banks of my river are made</p>
<p>From the scars of my old ground<br />
And from the memory of my blood burning in fire<br />
From the darkness opening in colour<br />
Arm in arm and a flower in each gun<br />
The edges of my people are made</p>
<p>I&#8217;m singing about the people that have just discovered themselves<br />
And raise their voices, celebrate<br />
I&#8217;m singing the praises of the land that is reborn<br />
There can&#8217;t be enough songs like this</p>
<p>In each vein the blood is waiting its turn<br />
In each conversation we hunt the day<br />
This is how we learn about the tides<br />
This is how we grow and become men<br />
A new song is born</p>
<p>Awaken lights on the evening-blind door posts<br />
Raise your voices and celebrate<br />
Sing wide awake in the morning that the night delivered us<br />
There can&#8217;t be enough songs like this</p>
<p>Sing about the tides in those Sargasso beaches<br />
Raise your voices, celebrate<br />
Run, barefooted, by the wharf, open your arms and hug<br />
There can&#8217;t be enough songs like this<br />
There can&#8217;t be enough songs like this<br />
