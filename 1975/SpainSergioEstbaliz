<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
You&#8217;ll return to be again the natural girl<br />
Who took the life train before becoming woman</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll return, get off if you can<br />
And even though years can&#8217;t come back<br />
You&#8217;ll return, you&#8217;ll return<br />
Take your life and your backpack</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll return, though dressed in forgetfulness<br />
Even for the friend that taught you to kiss</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll return, the path is always shorter<br />
And even if you return empty-handed<br />
You&#8217;ll return, you&#8217;ll return<br />
Take your life and your backpack<br />
Return now</p>
<p>I know you left your olive trees behind<br />
Your family and friends to triumph<br />
But don&#8217;t be worried if someone thinks<br />
That you played and lost, return now</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll return, now the train has stopped<br />
Now it has snowed in your temples<br />
You&#8217;ll return, you&#8217;ll return<br />
Take your life and your backpack<br />
Return now</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll return, you&#8217;ll return<br />
Take your life and your backpack<br />
Return now<br />
