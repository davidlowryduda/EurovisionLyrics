You see? &#8211; The song is a letter<br />
That you write for yourself and then throw away<br />
It never sees the mailbox<br />
However</p>
<p>You have the courage to say in it: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
Because it&#8217;s someone else on the stage<br />
Who comes and shout it without fearing<br />
The spotlights</p>
<p>A song is a letter<br />
That you write in your head<br />
A song is a letter<br />
That you never, that you never mail</p>
<p>Love is always perfect in it<br />
You&#8217;re never afraid to feel silly<br />
When your heart is ready to surrender<br />
To another heart</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to say: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
In an alexandrine of your poem<br />
Love on stage doesn&#8217;t match love<br />
In real life</p>
<p>A song is a letter<br />
That you write in your head<br />
A song is a letter<br />
That the postman will never ever take along</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s both leave on that ship&#8221;<br />
That&#8217;s something I can&#8217;t say<br />
My throat squeezes and gets stuck<br />
At the idea</p>
<p>That one day I&#8217;d have to write you<br />
Those words planted there on the other shore<br />
It&#8217;s a mistake to write you a letter<br />
So I sang</p>
<p>A song is a letter<br />
That you write in your head<br />
A song is a letter<br />
That the postman will never take along</p>
<p>A song is a letter<br />
That you write in your head<br />
A song is a letter<br />
That stays inside of you, that crumples and dies<br />
