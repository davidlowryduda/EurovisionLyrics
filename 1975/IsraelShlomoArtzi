<p>You rise like a sun that sits above me<br />
And writes my day with its rays<br />
You are close like rain on my head and on my face<br />
And the water in my mouth is to my liking</p>
<p>You and me, ah ah ah&#8230;<br />
You and me, yes, ah ah ah&#8230;<br />
Like thunder and lightning until the edges of the sea</p>
<p>You and me<br />
You and me, yes<br />
It sounds stronger than the world</p>
<p>Day and night, we both spin tirelessly<br />
Coming from one another and returning to one another<br />
Like the colours of the rainbow we&#8217;ll tie a cloud to a string<br />
And we&#8217;ll tell him, listen, good days are ahead</p>
<p>You and me, ah ah ah&#8230;<br />
You and me, yes, ah ah ah&#8230;<br />
Like thunder and lightning until the edges of the sea</p>
<p>You and me<br />
You and me, yes<br />
It sounds stronger than the world</p>
<p>Like the colours of the rainbow we&#8217;ll tie a cloud to a string<br />
And we&#8217;ll tell him, listen, good days are ahead</p>
<p>You and me, ah ah ah&#8230;<br />
You and me, yes, ah ah ah&#8230;<br />
Like thunder and lightning until the edges of the sea</p>
<p>You and me<br />
You and me, yes<br />
It sounds stronger than the world</p>
<p>You and me<br />
You and me<br />
