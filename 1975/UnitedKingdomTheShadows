<p>Let me be the one who&#8217;s lovin&#8217; you tonight<br />
Let me be the one who really holds you tight<br />
I&#8217;ll even bring along a magic moon just to make you feel all right<br />
So let me be the one who&#8217;s lovin&#8217; you tonight</p>
<p>Let me be the one who takes you by the hand (Let me be the one)<br />
Let me be the one who always understands (Let me be the one)<br />
Everybody knows we&#8217;ve been good friends, but I think the time is right<br />
So let me be the one who&#8217;s lovin&#8217; you tonight</p>
<p>You and I could have an affair<br />
(All you gotta do is&#8230;) Make sweet music, go anywhere<br />
Building highways taking us there<br />
As long as I know you really care<br />
Won&#8217;t you show me you care?</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; come on<br />
Let me be the one who&#8217;s lovin&#8217; you tonight<br />
Let me be the one who really holds you tight<br />
I&#8217;ll even bring along a magic moon, just to make you feel all right<br />
So let me be the one who&#8217;s lovin&#8217; you tonight</p>
<p>Doo doo doo doo&#8230;<br />
Won&#8217;t you show me you care?</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; come on<br />
Let me be the one who takes you by the hand<br />
Let me be the one who always understands<br />
Everybody knows we&#8217;ve been good friends, but I think the time is right<br />
So let me be the one who&#8217;s lovin&#8217; you tonight</p>
