Here&#8217;s a flute and a flute man, I&#8217;m not playing to the standards<br />
I flute away my troubles<br />
If I can&#8217;t interpret my feelings with words my flute surely plays for them<br />
And from them the sounds of my soul created my little song</p>
<p>There is the smell of the morning dew<br />
The warmth of spring, the running water of the mountain stream<br />
My flute plays everything I feel</p>
<p>There is the darkening night, the colours of the sun<br />
The never ending belief in a better future<br />
There is autumn&#8217;s sadness, there is the pain of life<br />
My flute plays all that</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a flute and a flute man<br />
I see nature as a painting, I will play it all to you in a song<br />
And this is how joy, sorrow and everyday life sounds if I can&#8217;t feel them right<br />
Every disappointment, laughter is a reason for a song</p>
<p>There is the beautiful flight of a butterfly<br />
The last flight of a fading star<br />
My flute plays everything I feel</p>
<p>There is the chilly frost of the snowy winter<br />
The smallness of man under the universe<br />
There is autumn&#8217;s sadness, there is the pain of life<br />
My flute plays all that</p>
<p>There is the beautiful flight of a butterfly<br />
The last flight of a fading star<br />
My flute plays everything I feel</p>
<p>There is the chilly frost of the snowy winter<br />
The smallness of man under the universe<br />
There is autumn&#8217;s sadness, there is the pain of life<br />
My flute plays all that<br />
