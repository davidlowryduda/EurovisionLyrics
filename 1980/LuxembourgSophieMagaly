Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin is bored on the ice floe</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin wants to pack his suitcase</p>
<p>He feels nervous, a little unhappy<br />
Doesn&#8217;t feel very well in his feathers<br />
To calm down his nerves, he dives into the sea</p>
<p>He envies the bird that is flying up there next to the moon<br />
He has lead feet, it makes him grumpy<br />
(Pa papapa papapa papapa&#8230;)<br />
(Papapa papapa papapa papapa&#8230;)</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin is bored on the ice floe</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin wants to pack his suitcase</p>
<p>On the blue snow he makes an insecure step<br />
And slips on the ice<br />
He murmurs: &#8220;I want to leave&#8221;</p>
<p>Very high in the sky, closer to the sun<br />
Crossing space<br />
&#8220;I have wings of a bird, I can fly high&#8221;<br />
(Pa papapa papapa papapa&#8230;)<br />
(Papapa papapa papapa papapa&#8230;)</p>
<p>But look papa, why do you say that?<br />
You know that the wings<br />
Of penguins and mills<br />
Are good for nothing</p>
<p>But why, papa, go there?<br />
Here life is beautiful<br />
Leave the sky to the angels and the saints<br />
Come, papa, papapa papapa papapa&#8230;<br />
Papapa papapa papapa..</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin pursues his wonderful dream</p>
<p>Look how he pretends to be a big seagull<br />
He makes long journeys<br />
He travels down south as far as England</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s Paris, Rome and Naples<br />
The shores of Carthage<br />
And the Mediterranean, how beautiful is the summer<br />
(Pa papapa papapa papapa&#8230;)<br />
(Papapa papapa papapa papapa&#8230;)</p>
<p>But look papa, don&#8217;t you think about it?<br />
You know very well that wings<br />
Of penguins and mills<br />
Are good for nothing</p>
<p>But why, papa, go there?<br />
Here life is beautiful<br />
If you leave, you won&#8217;t go very far<br />
Stay here, papapa papapa papapa&#8230;<br />
Papapa papapa papapa..</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin gives up his fantasy</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin comes back down to earth</p>
<p>(Papa penguin, papa penguin)<br />
(Papa, papa, papa penguin)<br />
(Papa penguin loves his ice floe)</p>
<p>Papa penguin, papa penguin<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
Papa penguin is going to burn his suitcase</p>
<p>(Papa penguin, papa penguin)<br />
Papa, papa, papa penguin<br />
