Very small, sometimes he took me by the hand<br />
And happy, with small steps, I walked along the paths<br />
To the city of a thousand lights, alongside my father<br />
To the extraordinary and magic world of cinema</p>
<p>Peter Pan, he was the tallest for all the little children<br />
And Mickey was so cheerful when he sang in the meadows<br />
Alice in Wonderland on Sunday afternoon<br />
Was blonde, was beautiful, and the film never ended</p>
<p>Cinema, cinema, the whole world is crazy about you<br />
Cinema, cinema, you are the king of the children<br />
Your pictures and your lights bring their fantasies to life<br />
Like a carousel of dreams, turning and turning until infinity</p>
<p>Fred Astaire made me crazy when his feet clicked on the ground<br />
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and the world of Walt Disney<br />
The universe of my childhood will never leave me</p>
<p>Cinema, cinema, the whole world is crazy about you<br />
Cinema, cinema, you are the king of the children<br />
Your pictures and your lights bring their fantasies to life<br />
Like a carousel of dreams, turning and turning until infinity</p>
<p>Cinema, cinema, the whole world is crazy about you<br />
Cinema, cinema, you are the king of the children<br />
Your pictures and your lights bring their fantasies to life<br />
Like a carousel of dreams, turning and turning until infinity<br />
