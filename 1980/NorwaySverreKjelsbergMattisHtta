A simple tune, two small words: Lapland, Sami earth<br />
It came with the wind from north, from north, Lapland</p>
<p>Can a demand get any softer: Lapland, the land of the Sami people<br />
It grew from a breeze to a storm, from a breeze to a storm, Lapland</p>
<p>In front of the parliament where they sat, Lapland, Lapland<br />
The yoik was heard day and night, Lapland</p>
<p>In front of the parliament where they sat, oy&#8230;<br />
The yoik was heard day and night, Lapland</p>
<p>Yoik is stronger than gunpowder, Lapland<br />
Because a yoik never ends, oh&#8230; Lapland</p>
<p>Because a yoik never ends, Lapland<br />
