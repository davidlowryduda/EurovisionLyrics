They put a mask on every evening<br />
And they play the role they have to play<br />
They have sold their hearts to the theatre<br />
They&#8217;re standing up there and those below look at them</p>
<p>They&#8217;re kings, beggars, clowns in the footlight<br />
But how it looks deep inside them, you can&#8217;t see</p>
<p>Theatre, theatre, the curtain opens<br />
Then the stage becomes the world<br />
Theatre, theatre, it&#8217;s like an intoxication<br />
And it&#8217;s only the moment that counts</p>
<p>Like a burning fever, like a piece of happiness<br />
A long forgotten dream comes back to life<br />
Theatre, theatre, hated and loved<br />
Heaven and hell at the same time</p>
<p>And the clown has to laugh, even if he wants to cry<br />
And the audience doesn&#8217;t see that a tear is rolling down<br />
And the hero has to be strong, and fight for the right<br />
But often he&#8217;s got stage fright</p>
<p>Everything is just like theatre, but it&#8217;s also reality<br />
Theatre, the gateway to fantasy<br />
Theatre, theatre, the only one who stays true<br />
Who loves you with passion</p>
<p>Theatre, theatre (And the clown has to laugh)<br />
Is life and dream (Even if he wants to cry)<br />
Beginning and ending at the same time<br />
(And the audience doesn&#8217;t see that a tear is rolling down)</p>
<p>Theatre, theatre (And the hero has to be strong)<br />
You give us the applause (And fight for the right)<br />
We give everything for you<br />
(But often he&#8217;s got stage fright)</p>
<p>And laugh and cry for you (Theatre, theatre)<br />
Yes, we give everything for you<br />
