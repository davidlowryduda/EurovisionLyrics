If I&#8217;d lose you, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do<br />
I&#8217;ll remember forever, every minute I lived with you<br />
My hands are empty, but<br />
I don&#8217;t hide the love that I&#8217;ll always feel for you</p>
<p>In the bottom of my heart I don&#8217;t know why<br />
I would embrace you one more time</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I can give to stop the time<br />
To sleep beside you only for one night<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I can give<br />
To take you close to me only for one night</p>
<p>Then the stars and the moon and you<br />
With the wings of a swan will fly down 	 </p>
<p>My hands are empty, but<br />
I don&#8217;t hide the love that I&#8217;ll always feel for you<br />
In the bottom of my heart I don&#8217;t know why<br />
I would embrace you one more time</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I can give to stop the time<br />
To sleep beside you only for one night<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I can give<br />
To take you close to me only for one night</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I can give to stop the time<br />
To sleep beside you only for one night<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I can give<br />
To take you close to me only for one night</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I can give to stop the time<br />
To sleep beside you only for one night<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I can give<br />
To take you close to me only for one night<br />
