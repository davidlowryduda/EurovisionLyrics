He&#8217;s tired of the city, nothing happens<br />
Everything is as usual around here<br />
The weekdays creep by, the weekend flies by<br />
The same talk every day about breaking free</p>
<p>Right now I want to live, right now<br />
Right now I want to feel, right now</p>
<p>Feel the air in my lungs, feel the blood pumping<br />
Feel the light in my eyes, feel time passing</p>
<p>He wants to go away, perhaps down to Paris<br />
And find adventure somehow<br />
And not just sitting here at the local caf√©<br />
Just letting the thoughts flutter by</p>
<p>Right now I want to live, right now<br />
Right now I want to feel, right now</p>
<p>Feel the air in my lungs, feel the blood pumping<br />
Feel the light in my eyes, feel time passing</p>
<p>Feel the air in my lungs (right now)<br />
Feel the blood pumping (right now)<br />
Feel the light in my eyes (right now)<br />
Feel time passing (right now)</p>
<p>Right now I want to live, right now<br />
Right now I want to feel, right now</p>
<p>Feel the air in my lungs (right now)<br />
Feel the blood pumping (right now)<br />
Feel the light in my eyes (right now)<br />
Feel time passing (right now)</p>
<p>Right now I want to live, right now<br />
Right now I want to feel, right now</p>
<p>Feel the air in my lungs (right now)<br />
Feel the blood pumping (right now)<br />
Feel the light in my eyes (right now)<br />
Feel time passing (right now)<br />
