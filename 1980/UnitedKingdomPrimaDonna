<p>If there&#8217;s a place in your heart for me<br />
There&#8217;s a room in my place for you<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Love enough for two</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t every road that leads me home<br />
It isn&#8217;t every day I&#8217;m on my own<br />
But when I&#8217;m feeling sad and all alone<br />
I think of you, yes, I do</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a very special kind of style<br />
There&#8217;s something in your eyes each time you smile<br />
So tell me you can stay for just a while<br />
And love me too</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a place in your heart for me<br />
There&#8217;s a room in my place for you<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ve got love enough for two</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a time in your life for me<br />
I&#8217;ve got a lifetime to spend with you<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Love enough for two</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t every day you meet someone<br />
You wanna pin your wildest dreams upon<br />
It&#8217;s true you haven&#8217;t known me very long<br />
But I hope and pray that you&#8217;ll stay</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something in the way you touch my soul<br />
It seemed that I was half, but now I&#8217;m whole<br />
You&#8217;ve got me under your complete control<br />
In every way</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a place in your heart for me<br />
There&#8217;s a room in my place for you<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ve got love enough for two</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a&#8230;<br />
If there&#8217;s a time in your life for me<br />
I&#8217;ve got a lifetime to spend with you</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Love enough for two</p>
<p>Oh, I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Oh, I&#8217;ve got love enough&#8230;<br />
Love enough for two</p>
