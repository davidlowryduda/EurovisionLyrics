It&#8217;s today that I&#8217;ll be leaving, my friend<br />
I&#8217;m looking forward to when we meet again<br />
For it is here with you I feel best<br />
Yes, you&#8217;re the one I love the most of all</p>
<p>When I have to leave you like this<br />
Do you know that I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p>Always thinking of you?<br />
That you&#8217;re my light<br />
That always shows the way</p>
<p>I know you have a dream<br />
That one day we can enjoy ourselves and just relax<br />
That we can live, like everybody else does<br />
That we can get what we had before</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to change me<br />
Can it comfort you, that I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p>Always thinking of you?<br />
That you&#8217;re my light<br />
That always shows the way</p>
<p>My friend I hope that you after all<br />
Will hang on, for we&#8217;ve together chosen<br />
The life that keeps me away for so long<br />
Sometimes several days running</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve now said goodbye to you<br />
I hope, you know, that I&#8217;m&#8230;</p>
<p>Always thinking of you<br />
That you&#8217;re my light<br />
That always shows the way</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always thinking about you<br />
For you&#8217;re my light<br />
That always shows the way<br />
