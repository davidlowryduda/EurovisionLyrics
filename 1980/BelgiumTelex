Beautiful ladies, beautiful gentlemen<br />
Music on the programme<br />
Singers, get ready<br />
May the best win</p>
<p>The borders are open<br />
What should I say if tonight is a party?<br />
The stars are nervous<br />
They do their make up, smoke a cigarette<br />
Before going on stage</p>
<p>Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision<br />
Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision</p>
<p>Old Europe cheers<br />
The country that wins<br />
Then a tear<br />
The spell is broken</p>
<p>The eyes of the whole world<br />
Are waiting, impatiently, for news flashes<br />
That are going to announce<br />
By satellite and by shielded cables<br />
What&#8217;s happening in their regions</p>
<p>Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision<br />
Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision</p>
<p>Eurovision, Eurovision, Eurovision<br />
