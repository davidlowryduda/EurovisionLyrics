<p>I&#8217;ve been waitin&#8217; such a long time<br />
Lookin&#8217; out for you, but you&#8217;re not here<br />
What&#8217;s another year?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wakin&#8217; such a long time<br />
Reachin&#8217; out for you, but you aren&#8217;t near<br />
What&#8217;s another year?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s another year<br />
For someone who&#8217;s lost everything that he owns?<br />
What&#8217;s another year<br />
For someone who&#8217;s gettin&#8217; used to bein&#8217; alone?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been prayin&#8217; such a long time<br />
It&#8217;s the only way to hide the fear<br />
What&#8217;s another year?</p>

With such a lot of pain in every tear<br />
