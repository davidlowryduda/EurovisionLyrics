<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
A quiet rainy day, I close my eyes, wander far away<br />
I paint a shadow over past days and fade away</p>
<p>How well I merge with this world that dazes me<br />
How I&#8217;m absorbed in time that doesn&#8217;t exist</p>
<p>What would the world be without dreams (What would?)<br />
When good luck squanders?<br />
What would time be without dreams? (What would?)<br />
Life would be in vain</p>
<p>What would the world be without dreams (What would?)<br />
When good luck squanders?<br />
What would time be without dreams?<br />
Time without dreams</p>
<p>The blue sky there, in the distance, the bell is heard<br />
In the morning breeze another victim follows me</p>
<p>How well I merge with this world that dazes me<br />
How I&#8217;m absorbed in time that doesn&#8217;t exist</p>
<p>What would the world be without dreams (What would?)<br />
When good luck squanders?<br />
What would time be without dreams? (What would?)<br />
Life would be in vain</p>
<p>What would the world be without dreams (What would?)<br />
When good luck squanders?<br />
What would time be without dreams?<br />
Time without dreams<br />
