Come to me, be a white cloud in the sky<br />
Come to me, be a dew in the morning<br />
Come to me, come, let&#8217;s get on the airship<br />
Come to me, come, let&#8217;s run to the world</p>
<p>Come to me, come quietly, come secretly<br />
Come to me, bring a light to the dark night<br />
Come to me, the most beautiful flame burns a moment<br />
Come to me, come to me, come to me</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s listen, let&#8217;s watch, let&#8217;s go<br />
Come to me, there&#8217;s only a little moment of time<br />
Come to me, doors will soon be closed<br />
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s listen, let&#8217;s watch, let&#8217;s go<br />
Come to me, there&#8217;s only a little moment of time<br />
Come to me, doors will soon be closed<br />
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me</p>
<p>Come to me, touch me like a wave touches the beach<br />
Come to me, bring a peace to the surge of soul<br />
Come to me, wind carries a wish far away<br />
Come to me, come to me, come to me</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s listen, let&#8217;s watch, let&#8217;s go<br />
Come to me, there&#8217;s only a little moment of time<br />
Come to me, doors will soon be closed<br />
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s listen, let&#8217;s watch, let&#8217;s go<br />
Come to me, there&#8217;s only a little moment of time<br />
Come to me, doors will soon be closed<br />
To the care of a white cloud in the sky, come to me</p>
<p>Come to me<br />
