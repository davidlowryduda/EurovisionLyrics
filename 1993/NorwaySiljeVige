When I meet you in the street<br />
And you stop and smile this strange smile<br />
And you stand there, pretending nothing has happened<br />
Afraid to meet my glance<br />
No one can see it, only you and I know it</p>
<p>When I meet you in the evening<br />
And you look at me with this strange light<br />
And you gently touch me<br />
On the hand as you walk past me<br />
No one must see it, only you and I know it</p>
<p>All my thoughts, they fly to you<br />
All my dreams are open<br />
In all my rooms, I can only see you<br />
You are lying in my bed sleeping, sleeping</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re among your friends<br />
And your beautiful laughter melts my skin<br />
And you pretend you&#8217;ve never seen me before<br />
You are like a distant and cool god<br />
No one must see it, only you and I know it</p>
<p>All my thoughts, they fly to you<br />
All my dreams are open<br />
In all my rooms, I can only see you<br />
You are lying in my bed sleeping, sleeping</p>
<p>All my thoughts, they fly to you<br />
All my dreams are open<br />
In all my rooms, I can only see you<br />
You are lying in my bed sleeping, sleeping<br />
