I can&#8217;t take the stars down from the sky<br />
I can&#8217;t find the way, the way to universe<br />
But I can send you this song<br />
So you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m alive, my love</p>
<p>Tonight when tears on my face freeze up<br />
I won&#8217;t let the fear take me over<br />
I still have the strength to win alone<br />
If we were together, it&#8217;d be easier</p>
<p>All the pain in the world tonight is in Bosnia<br />
I&#8217;m staying to defy the fear<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid to stand in front of the wall<br />
I can sing, I can win</p>
<p>Tonight when tears on my face freeze up<br />
I won&#8217;t let the fear take me over<br />
Who will be the guard instead of me<br />
So that another evil doesn&#8217;t occur?</p>
<p>All the pain in the world tonight is in Bosnia<br />
I&#8217;m staying to defy the fear<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid to stand in front of the wall<br />
I can sing, I can win</p>
<p>All the pain in the world tonight is in Bosnia<br />
I&#8217;m staying to defy the fear<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid to stand in front of the wall<br />
I can sing, I can win<br />
