Somewhere in time and space<br />
There must be far worlds<br />
Untouched and beautiful and still filled with life</p>
<p>Life without fear and misery<br />
No hatred and malice to be found<br />
Stars, bright and clear, so you can almost touch them<br />
I believe in it</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s much too far away<br />
Outside in the darkness<br />
Much too far away<br />
Here is our reality</p>
<p>Somewhere in that dream<br />
There must be far wishes<br />
None is as deep as our wish to live</p>
<p>Life like in paradise<br />
Without paying for it<br />
So you can paint in thousand colours like a painting<br />
I believe in it</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s much too far away<br />
Outside in the darkness<br />
Much too far away<br />
Here is our reality</p>
<p>Much too far away<br />
Further away than ever before<br />
Much too far away<br />
Yet so near to touch</p>
<p>Much too far away<br />
Outside in the darkness<br />
Much too far away<br />
Here is our reality</p>
<p>Somewhere in time and space<br />
There has been a world<br />
Untouched and beautiful, and with that, life has begun<br />
And what came next?<br />
And what came next?<br />
