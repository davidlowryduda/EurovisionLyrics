She always has a little wine<br />
Some fruits, a bit of bread<br />
For the starving friends<br />
Mama Corsica</p>
<p>Her heart is as wide as the sky<br />
She&#8217;s as sincere as she&#8217;s beautiful<br />
Mama Corsica</p>
<p>She&#8217;s like those old ladies in black<br />
Who bear their story inside themselves<br />
Mama Corsica</p>
<p>It even seems that the Good Lord<br />
Was crazy in love with her<br />
Drawing her with his fingers</p>
<p>Mama Corsica, tonight we&#8217;re singing in Corsican for you<br />
Mama Corsica, on behalf of love and friendship<br />
Mama Corsica, tonight the world has only eyes for you<br />
Mama Corsica, as if the world sung in Corsican to greet you</p>
<p>She always prays for her boys<br />
When they are far from home<br />
Mama Corsica</p>
<p>She smiles when you&#8217;re thinking of her<br />
She likes it when you&#8217;re faithful to her<br />
Mama Corsica</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe everything what people say<br />
Basically it&#8217;s her who unites us<br />
Mama Corsica</p>
<p>Never mind that there are differences<br />
She doesn&#8217;t have preferences<br />
All her children have Corsican blood</p>
<p>Mama Corsica, tonight we&#8217;re singing in Corsican for you<br />
Mama Corsica, on behalf of love, tonight you&#8217;re the land of friendship<br />
Mama Corsica, tonight the world has only eyes for you<br />
Mama Corsica, as if the world sung in Corsican to greet you</p>
<p>Mama Corsica<br />
Mama Corsica<br />
