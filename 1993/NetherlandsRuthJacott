Even the most expensive car can&#8217;t swim<br />
And when it&#8217;s wet, it has trouble braking<br />
That&#8217;s why something is done to the asphalt<br />
So that no drop of water remains on it</p>
<p>We all know that magicians deceive<br />
And that no man on earth can fly by himself<br />
The real reason why the airplane exists now<br />
Is the fact that gliding doesn&#8217;t happen on its own</p>
<p>We build houses to withstand hurricanes<br />
And make ships to sail in every storm<br />
We&#8217;re working on a light bulb that never burns out<br />
It only just won&#8217;t work to keep peace<br />
(To keep)</p>
<p>Each new apple tree that is born<br />
Isn&#8217;t endowed by nature with ears to hear<br />
But through genetics we&#8217;ll manage to teach it<br />
To guarantee taste and quality</p>
<p>We build houses to withstand hurricanes<br />
And make ships to sail in every storm<br />
We&#8217;re working on a light bulb that never burns out<br />
It only just won&#8217;t work to keep peace</p>
<p>When no bridge is too far<br />
Every clock will chime at the same hour<br />
When no road is too long<br />
No man wants to hit another man ever again<br />
Woh, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>We build houses to withstand hurricanes<br />
And make ships to sail in every storm<br />
We&#8217;re working on a light bulb that never burns out<br />
It only just won&#8217;t work to keep peace<br />
