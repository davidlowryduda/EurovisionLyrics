In the morning I go out, into the street<br />
The city is in front of me<br />
And suddenly the city is yours and mine<br />
The city is everyone&#8217;s</p>
<p>Between a gin and a kiss<br />
We&#8217;re going from pub to pub<br />
I feel everything I see<br />
There&#8217;s a glow in the air</p>
<p>When the night falls in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream and there&#8217;s magic<br />
At night in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream until it&#8217;s daytime</p>
<p>The colours of the night<br />
Give a glow to the city<br />
They make light until it&#8217;s dawn</p>
<p>Between the moon and the sun<br />
We&#8217;re going from street to street<br />
Tomorrow morning<br />
It&#8217;ll be another day</p>
<p>When the night falls in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream and there&#8217;s magic<br />
At night in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream until it&#8217;s daytime</p>
<p>(When the night falls in the city)<br />
(There&#8217;s always a dream and there&#8217;s magic)<br />
At night in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream</p>
<p>When the night falls in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream and there&#8217;s magic<br />
At night in the city<br />
There&#8217;s always a dream<br />
Until it&#8217;s daytime<br />
