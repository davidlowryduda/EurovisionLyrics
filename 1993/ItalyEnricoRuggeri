They run in their cars, they play taking each other<br />
Along a street bathed in bars<br />
They play living but they wear themselves out<br />
And the days never change</p>
<p>And the first light comes, beyond the outskirts<br />
And little houses carry them away<br />
And the dreams never change</p>
<p>Hurry up, sun, make you see<br />
They shoot again but they&#8217;re waiting for you<br />
Put a beam in your heart, if you discover where it is<br />
Rise for me, come up with me, warm me up again</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t know each other, still they resemble each other<br />
And the dreams never change</p>
<p>If they take your hand, they are looking for some company<br />
But the wind and the war carry them away<br />
But the dreams never change</p>
<p>Wake up, sun, so we can feel you<br />
Today nobody asks for you<br />
Cover Europe with light, do you remember where it is?<br />
Come with me, fly with me, warm me up again</p>
<p>They change their uniform and colour<br />
But their tired souls wait for the sun<br />
And they say he&#8217;ll come<br />
They believe he&#8217;ll come</p>
<p>Wake us up, sun, make us understand<br />
How much pain you&#8217;ve carried with you<br />
Give us a light beam in this gloom<br />
Rise for us, come up with us, warm us up again<br />
