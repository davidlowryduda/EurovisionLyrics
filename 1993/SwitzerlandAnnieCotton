You, gentlemen, wind sellers<br />
You, trainers of performing dogs<br />
Magicians, snake charmers<br />
Dust in the eyes for children</p>
<p>On the great ball of fake dreams<br />
Where the stage is erected<br />
The guitars play in vain<br />
I won&#8217;t come dancing</p>
<p>Out of question to burn my wings<br />
Out of question to follow your steps<br />
I don&#8217;t have time</p>
<p>And if tomorrow luck is with me<br />
First of all, I want to be myself<br />
Quite simply myself</p>
<p>You, gentlemen, money makers<br />
You, the false-talent seekers<br />
Puppets in appearance<br />
Golden records and blank cheques</p>
<p>In the palace of vanities<br />
Limousins and publicity<br />
All your flashlights crackle in vain<br />
I won&#8217;t come prancing</p>
<p>Out of question to burn my wings<br />
Out of question to follow your steps<br />
I don&#8217;t have time</p>
<p>And if tomorrow luck is with me<br />
First of all, I want to be myself<br />
Quite simply myself</p>
<p>Out of question to burn my wings<br />
Out of question to follow your steps<br />
I don&#8217;t have time, don&#8217;t have time</p>
<p>And if tomorrow luck is with me<br />
First of all, I want to be myself<br />
Quite simply myself, wuite simply</p>
<p>And if tomorrow luck is with me<br />
Before all, I want to be myself<br />
Quite simply myself<br />
