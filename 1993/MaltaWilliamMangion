<p>Ooh baby, when I&#8217;m alone with you<br />
You show your love for me<br />
I beleived that our love was for real<br />
But I knew it was too good to be true</p>
<p>Oh baby, baby, when I found out<br />
That you were foolin&#8217; around with my heart<br />
It hurt so much, pain unexplained<br />
How could you do it? I thought I found love</p>
<p>This time I&#8217;m gonna stand on my own<br />
I said, now, baby, this time<br />
I won&#8217;t be missin&#8217; you at all<br />
No, no, now, baby, this time<br />
I&#8217;ll be strong, I won&#8217;t fall in love again</p>
<p>You thought I was usin&#8217; your love<br />
Wastin&#8217; all your time, that&#8217;s where you were wrong</p>
<p>Oh baby, baby, when I found out<br />
That you went wrong with foolin&#8217; around with my little heart<br />
It hurt so much, pain unexplained<br />
How could you do it when I thought I found love?</p>
<p>This time I&#8217;m gonna stand on my own<br />
Said, now, baby, this time<br />
I won&#8217;t be missin&#8217; you at all<br />
No, no, now, baby, baby (This time)<br />
I&#8217;ll be strong, I&#8217;ll be strong, yeah</p>
<p>This time<br />
I won&#8217;t be needin&#8217; your lovin&#8217; for me, baby<br />
Baby, babe, baby, I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; by<br />
This time<br />
