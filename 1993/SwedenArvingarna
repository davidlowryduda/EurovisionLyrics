I&#8217;m pulling myself together before I go out<br />
I thought that I was smart when I broke up with you, ah&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m missing you and here I am in front of your door<br />
If I ring the bell, will you open your door, or do you want me to leave?<br />
So I&#8217;m asking you, please come out to me</p>
<p>Eloise, are we more than just friends?<br />
If so, show me what your feel and later on our emotions can rule<br />
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one<br />
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy when you can&#8217;t see your own mistakes<br />
I&#8217;m like a small ball, in a pinball game, ah&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m missing you and here I am in front of your door<br />
If I ring the bell, will you open your door, or do you want me to leave?<br />
So I&#8217;m asking you, please come out to me</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; Eloise, are we more than just friends?<br />
If so, show me what your feel and later on our emotions can rule<br />
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one<br />
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting and hoping and longing, please tell me&#8230;<br />
Eloise, even the winds can change, for me you are the only one<br />
Our love is worth a higher price, Eloise<br />
