<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Into our lives we enter naked<br />
The same end and beginning define us<br />
But there are some of us<br />
The beggars of happiness</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop helping people<br />
Don&#8217;t overtake, don&#8217;t fear seeing the wrecks<br />
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth<br />
Don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t stop</p>
<p>Whatever you own I own as well, brother<br />
But there are others who never laughed<br />
Their sight is unclear<br />
And they carry a cross</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop helping people<br />
Don&#8217;t overtake, don&#8217;t fear seeing the wrecks<br />
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth<br />
Don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t stop</p>
<p>And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth<br />
Don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t stop<br />
And if life is occasionally hurt by the truth<br />
Don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t stop</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stop, don&#8217;t stop<br />
Don&#8217;t stop<br />
