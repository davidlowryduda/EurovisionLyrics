Mary Magdalene, give me your power<br />
Forever and not just for one night</p>
<p>Like thunder without any warning, like the first day<br />
Like the Flood, more than I can suffer<br />
You were coming over me, you ran over me<br />
You conquered my heart in a storm, like a hurricane</p>
<p>Heaven or hell, where you come from is all the same to me<br />
Both inside of you, good and evil, it makes me poor and rich</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene, you are happiness and sorrow<br />
Mary Magdalene, give me eternity<br />
Mary Magdalene, give me your might<br />
Forever and not just for one night</p>
<p>Your eyes crying for love, yearning is the name for your look<br />
Going onwards, never again backwards<br />
You are one of the sirens, seen by Odysseus<br />
I untie myself and place myself in danger</p>
<p>Only those who suffer are alive, who feels nothing are dead<br />
To take pain, to give love, that&#8217;s my command</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene, you are happiness and sorrow<br />
Mary Magdalene, give me eternity<br />
Mary Magdalene, give me your might<br />
Forever and not just for one night</p>
<p>Maria Magdalena, you are happiness and sorrow<br />
Maria Magdalena, give me eternity<br />
Maria Magdalena, give me your might<br />
Forever and not just for one night<br />
