Alone, looking into the night<br />
A star shines, maybe for me<br />
It&#8217;s not easy to say that my life capsizes<br />
I need you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a game we&#8217;ve got to live<br />
I want to know if I already lost it<br />
But I still want to believe in it<br />
Telling you about all my hopes</p>
<p>Give me a chance to tell you<br />
The words that will lead you<br />
On the road of your desires</p>
<p>Give me a chance to tell you<br />
The words to seduce you<br />
To live all our pleasures again</p>
<p>Turn my world with a bit of nice care<br />
Be my rose that always blossoms for me<br />
Be my star in the night<br />
But I still want to believe in it<br />
Tell you about all my hopes</p>
<p>Give me a chance to tell you<br />
The words that will lead you<br />
On the road of your desires</p>
<p>Give me a chance to tell you<br />
The words to seduce you<br />
To live all our pleasures again</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow you&#8217;ll be going far away<br />
But give me my chance, I need you so much</p>
<p>Give me a chance to tell you<br />
The words that will lead you<br />
On the road of your desires</p>
<p>Give me a chance to tell you<br />
The words to seduce you<br />
To live all our pleasures again<br />
