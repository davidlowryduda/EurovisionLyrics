Greece, country of light<br />
The world&#8217;s beginning and comeback<br />
A place chosen by God<br />
Something&#8217;s going on, you don&#8217;t give a damn</p>
<p>Difficult times are coming<br />
And the sky is shouting to you<br />
Sit down and think, get to your senses</p>
<p>One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli<br />
Children of Plato and Aristotle<br />
They trick us with sadness and taste<br />
Oh immortal spirit, the evil is destroying you</p>
<p>One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli<br />
Children of Plato and Aristotle<br />
They trick us with sadness and taste<br />
Oh immortal spirit, the evil is destroying you</p>
<p>Greece, country of light<br />
Peaceful warrior<br />
Make another move ahead<br />
Go forward, it&#8217;s time</p>
<p>You are the world&#8217;s wine<br />
Even if you don&#8217;t know it<br />
Sit down and figure it out and stand up and tell it</p>
<p>One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli<br />
Children of Plato and Aristotle<br />
They trick us with sadness and taste<br />
Oh immortal spirit, the evil is destroying you</p>
<p>One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli<br />
Children of Plato and Aristotle<br />
They trick us with sadness and taste<br />
Oh immortal spirit, the evil is destroying you</p>
<p>One time they play us rock music and the other tsifteteli<br />
Children of Plato and Aristotle<br />
