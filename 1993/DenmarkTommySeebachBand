I sit down on the edge of your bed and you laugh at me<br />
The world shrinks to nothing when I look at you<br />
You&#8217;re lying as quiet as a mouse and seem indescribably small<br />
Among all of your funny bears<br />
But in the dream game we find the way out to new adventures</p>
<p>Under the stars of the sky, you&#8217;re sailing with me<br />
Close your eyes silently now, then we&#8217;re on our way<br />
We&#8217;re sailing across the water and into the dream land, you and I</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re frightened by the wind<br />
I&#8217;ll kiss you gently on the cheak<br />
Wherever you are in your imagination<br />
I&#8217;ll always be here by you, my darling<br />
Now safely put your hand in mine</p>
<p>Under the stars of the sky, you&#8217;re sailing with me<br />
Close your eyes silently now, then we&#8217;re on our way<br />
We&#8217;re sailing across the water and into the dream land, you and I<br />
The dream land, you and I (Sailing, sailing into the dream)<br />
(Dream, dream land, you and I)<br />
