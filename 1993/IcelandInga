Open your eyes, see where you are<br />
I am and wait for you there<br />
The mind carries you through another path, but where?<br />
Still carrying on, questions start to burn</p>
<p>I wait, you look for answers all around<br />
Where does this journey end? For what are you leaving?<br />
Then years pass by and leave a little advise<br />
If you come to me then you&#8217;ll know the answer</p>
<p>Why are you running, searching far and near?<br />
I&#8217;m not hiding from you, I am everywhere</p>
<p>I wait, you look for answers all around<br />
Where does this journey end? For what are you leaving?<br />
Then years pass by and leave a little advise<br />
If you come to me then you&#8217;ll know the answer</p>
<p>I wait, you look for answers all around<br />
If you come to me then you&#8217;ll know the answer<br />
