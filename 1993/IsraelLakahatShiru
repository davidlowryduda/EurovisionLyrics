<p>On the banks of the Jordan, in bygone times<br />
I grew up among other people who sing<br />
They sang in the warm night to cheer up their spirit<br />
And they are those who left me my songs</p>
<p>Sing, sing with a great voice<br />
Don&#8217;t leave strength for tomorrow<br />
Sing, sing and light a fire<br />
Because the song is all we have</p>
<p>Sing, sing with a great voice<br />
Don&#8217;t leave strength for tomorrow<br />
Sing, sing and light a fire<br />
Because the song is all we have</p>
<p>And since then the songs accompany my life<br />
I always sing with my brothers and friends<br />
The warm singing of many people could break any wall<br />
And open hearts, plant loves</p>
<p>Sing, sing with a great voice<br />
Don&#8217;t leave strength for tomorrow<br />
Sing, sing and light a fire<br />
Because the song is all we have</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Sing a song, sing till you can no more<br />
Let the world know what you&#8217;re singing for<br />
Sing a song, oh, sing it loud and high<br />
Till it reaches up to the sky</em></font></p>
<p>The land has changed its image and its spirit<br />
But the singing of many people hasn&#8217;t lost its strength<br />
This song is uniting and it remains for us a witness<br />
And in every generation, the people carry a song</p>
<p>Sing, sing with a great voice<br />
Don&#8217;t leave strength for tomorrow<br />
Sing, sing and light a fire<br />
Because the song is all we have<br />
All we have</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Sing a song, sing till you can no more<br />
Let the world know what you&#8217;re singing for<br />
Sing a song, oh, sing it loud and high<br />
Till it reaches up to the sky</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Let the world know<br />
Sing a song</em></font><br />
