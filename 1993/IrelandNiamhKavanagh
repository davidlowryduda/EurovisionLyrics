<p>Showing no emotion, my feelings locked inside<br />
I made myself an island, trying to take my heart and hide<br />
I built a wall around me, afraid of letting go<br />
But suddenly an open door I never saw before</p>
<p>In your eyes (Your eyes) I see the light leading me home again<br />
It&#8217;s heaven in your arms, my love, my heart is in your hands (Heaven in your arms)<br />
In your eyes (Your eyes), seems so right, I see forever in your smile<br />
This woman is a child again (In your eyes)</p>
<p>Love&#8217;s been building bridges between your heart and mine<br />
I&#8217;m safe here on my island, but I&#8217;m out on the edge this time<br />
I built a wall around me, thought I&#8217;d save myself the pain<br />
Your touch swept me away, now I&#8217;ll never play it safe again</p>
<p>In your eyes (Your eyes) I see the light leading me home again<br />
It&#8217;s heaven in your arms, my love, my heart is in your hands (Heaven in your arms)<br />
In your eyes (Your eyes), seems so right, I see forever in your smile<br />
This woman is a child again</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been this close<br />
How do I know love will survive?<br />
I&#8217;m walking a tightrope<br />
Here, in your arms, I&#8217;m alive</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in your eyes (Your eyes) I see the light, I see forever in your smile<br />
This woman is a child again</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in your eyes (In your eyes I see the light leading me home again)<br />
I see the light, I see the light<br />
(It&#8217;s heaven in your arms, my love, my heart is in your hands) Whoa&#8230;<br />
(In your eyes, feels so right) I see forever in your smile<br />
This woman is a child again when I look in your eyes</p>
