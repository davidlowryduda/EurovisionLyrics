All men are so selfish<br />
That they&#8217;ve mistaken male for macho<br />
All men are so conceited<br />
That they&#8217;ve forgotten to be thankful</p>
<p>They&#8217;re like this by nature<br />
They live, ruled by their vanity<br />
They run, driven by their longing for winning<br />
And nothing else</p>
<p>They use their brain, never their heart<br />
They fly like crows around you<br />
And they say love for sex</p>
<p>They&#8217;re like this since prehistory<br />
They follow the whims of their will<br />
When they&#8217;ve got everything, they always want much more<br />
It&#8217;s normal</p>
<p>Whatever they may say, they&#8217;re right<br />
Whatever they may do, I&#8217;m telling you<br />
They can&#8217;t say sorry</p>
<p>All men are untidy<br />
And they keep being spoiled children<br />
All men are so special<br />
That they&#8217;ve managed to be all the same</p>
<p>But if they&#8217;re not around, we feel lonely<br />
They say little honeymouthed words<br />
Such beautiful things that make us sigh<br />
And drive us crazy</p>
<p>Men and women in intimacy<br />
Are like two lighthouses in the dark<br />
Like two mysteries to be solved<br />
They&#8217;re complementary like war and peace</p>
<p>Like sun and moon, like land and sea<br />
They&#8217;re irresistible, they&#8217;re like a magnet<br />
That makes the world go round</p>
<p>Whatever they may say, they&#8217;re right<br />
Whatever they may do, I&#8217;m telling you<br />
They can&#8217;t say sorry</p>
<p>Men and women in intimacy<br />
Are like two lighthouses in the dark<br />
Like two mysteries to be solved<br />
They&#8217;re complementary like war and peace</p>
<p>Like sun and moon, like land and sea<br />
They&#8217;re irresistible, they&#8217;re like a magnet<br />
That makes the world go round</p>
<p>Men and women in intimacy<br />
Are like two lighthouses in the dark<br />
Like two mysteries to be solved<br />
They&#8217;re complementary like war and peace</p>
<p>Like sun and moon, like land and sea<br />
They&#8217;re irresistible, they&#8217;re like a magnet<br />
