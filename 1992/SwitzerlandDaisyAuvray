I dreamt for so long that I could hold him in my arms<br />
I asked the conductor very silently:</p>
<p>Mister Music Man<br />
Do you want to play me a sweet tune?<br />
Do you have a slow, just for the two of us?<br />
I dream so much that I could take him in my arms</p>
<p>Mister Music Man<br />
Do you have a song from the old days<br />
That will make him dance with me?<br />
Mister, be very kind, come to my aid</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredible, I really did not expect it<br />
Unthinkable, when I came all alone tonight</p>
<p>Mister Music Man<br />
Do you want to play me a sweet tune?<br />
Put the lights down around us<br />
And let us dance with tenderness, and then I beg you<br />
Mister, if you agree, play it again and again</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredible, I had lost all hope<br />
Unthinkable, when I came all alone tonight</p>
<p>Mister Music Man<br />
Do you want to play me a sweet tune?<br />
Put the lights down around us<br />
And let us dance with tenderness, and then I beg you<br />
Mister, if you agree, play it again and again<br />
