I give you my lips, and into my existence<br />
With every cell of mine I wrap you<br />
You get lost in me, you play and get stuck<br />
And I hide you under my skin</p>
<p>We&#8217;re alike, you want what I want<br />
A night with no tomorrow<br />
We look alike, like two pieces of sky<br />
Which mix to become water and vanish<br />
We&#8217;re alike, we&#8217;re alike</p>
<p>Scattered signs, bodies surrendering<br />
And me begging for your touch<br />
In a complete picture, a mad minefield<br />
I become an explosion in front of you</p>
<p>We&#8217;re alike, you want what I want<br />
A night with no tomorrow<br />
We look alike, like two pieces of sky<br />
Which mix to become water and vanish<br />
We&#8217;re alike, we&#8217;re alike</p>
<p>We&#8217;re alike, you want what I want<br />
A night with no tomorrow<br />
We look alike, like two pieces of sky<br />
Which mix to become water and vanish<br />
We&#8217;re alike, we&#8217;re alike<br />
