<p>I am a prisoner of the melody, the addict to the rhythm<br />
That is why I believe in the fight against sadness<br />
To dance away all the distress, to sing into the darkness<br />
To plant for three minutes the flickering of happiness</p>
<p>And I have no desire to mince words<br />
This patronising is a tiring thing<br />
And I don&#8217;t mind not caring because the game is fun<br />
If there is a chance of one in a thousand to soar</p>
<p>And if the girl doesn&#8217;t do well<br />
She won&#8217;t cry, she won&#8217;t declare this her day of death</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s just sport, yes, it&#8217;s just sport<br />
It&#8217;s just sport, just sport<br />
Because it&#8217;s just sport, yes, it&#8217;s just sport<br />
It&#8217;s just sport, just sport</p>
<p>Yes, life is a fast line, and it&#8217;s a sure thing<br />
But tonight I have a song, and everything is still open<br />
I think that here, in the Promised Land<br />
You understand those who are willing to take the risk</p>
<p>And I have no desire to mince words<br />
It&#8217;s just nice and good for me doing a sloppy job<br />
With a guitarist and a drummer and with a cheeky keyboard player<br />
And with a chance of one in a thousand to soar</p>
<p>And if the girl doesn&#8217;t do well<br />
She won&#8217;t cry, she won&#8217;t declare this her day of death</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s just sport, yes, it&#8217;s just sport<br />
It&#8217;s just sport, just sport<br />
Because it&#8217;s just sport, yes, it&#8217;s just sport<br />
It&#8217;s just sport, just sport</p>
<p>And if the girl doesn&#8217;t do well<br />
She won&#8217;t cry, she won&#8217;t declare this her day of death</p>
<p>Viva sport, oh viva sport<br />
Viva, viva sport<br />
Viva sport, oh viva sport<br />
Viva, viva sport</p>
<p>Papa pada papa papa dei&#8230;<br />
