Just once before going<br />
Far away to another place<br />
We have to talk once again<br />
And see if we can go on</p>
<p>You&#8217;re my obsession, and only I beg God<br />
That tomorrow you will remember me<br />
Only a song can speak of love<br />
And tell all the sorrows that I have in my heart</p>
<p>All this is music, which surrounds your body<br />
Only this moment fills me with happiness<br />
All this is music, which I have so inside of me<br />
My memory, to be sincere, is for you</p>
<p>I think it was my fault<br />
But you left without saying goodbye<br />
Only between us, hate and love<br />
Are in our hearts</p>
<p>All this is music, which surrounds your body<br />
Only this moment fills me with happiness<br />
All this is music, which I have so inside of me<br />
My memory, to be sincere (is for you)</p>
<p>Everything good and bad in life<br />
Makes sense with music<br />
Music is happiness, and also sadness<br />
Peace, harmony and dreams<br />
And the taste of your kisses</p>
<p>All this is music, which surrounds your body<br />
Only this moment fills me with happiness<br />
All this is music, which I have so inside of me<br />
My memory, to be sincere, is for you, is for you<br />
