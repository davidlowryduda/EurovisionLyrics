When I saw your eyes of plum<br />
And your black berry mouth<br />
So much honey, so much sun<br />
In your juicy and wild lock of hair</p>
<p>I was sure it was you<br />
My grape sugar<br />
And nut on the table<br />
The love of strawberry and cashew</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
You laughed and made my head spin<br />
Come here, I&#8217;m thirsty<br />
I want your fresh water love</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
You laughed and made my head spin<br />
Come here, I&#8217;m thirsty<br />
I want your fresh water love, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>A tang of orange in your skin<br />
And three segments of laughter in your kiss<br />
So much honey, so much sun, fruit, juice, fresh water<br />
I tasted and I went crazy</p>
<p>It was in the morning that was alight in you<br />
Avocado, wild plum<br />
And French pear, pomegranate<br />
Raspberry, kiwi</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
You laughed and made my head spin<br />
Come here, I&#8217;m thirsty<br />
I want your fresh water love</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
You laughed and made my head spin<br />
Come, come, come here, I&#8217;m thirsty<br />
I want your fresh water love</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; it was in the morning that was alight in you<br />
Avocado, wild plum<br />
And French pear, pomegranate<br />
Raspberry, kiwi</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
You laughed and made my head spin<br />
Come, come, come here, I&#8217;m thirsty<br />
I want your fresh water love</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
You laughed and made my head spin<br />
Come, come, come here, I&#8217;m thirsty<br />
I want your fresh water love</p>
<p>I picked you, bit into you and put you in the basket<br />
