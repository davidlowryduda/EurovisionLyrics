Visions from a dream gives reflection and a prayer<br />
Let the future belong to us<br />
We only reap what we sow<br />
What have we understood then, of the time that has passed?<br />
Can the past carry the children of the future?</p>
<p>A century is ebbing out, a new era is knocking on our door<br />
Has progress led us astray?<br />
The fire of the past contains hot embers<br />
Nature is wounded, values are at stake<br />
Now we see all of yesterday&#8217;s mistakes</p>
<p>But the hope has been lit, it can never be too late<br />
For knowledge to put down roots<br />
Which provide us with courage and a will to create<br />
Culture is a heritage for the people of our country<br />
A mirror of times passed by</p>
<p>Give us a dawn with children&#8217;s laughter and song<br />
We love our father and mother, we have love to give to our sister and brother<br />
Give us a sunrise and let our dream be true<br />
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hand</p>
<p>We only have this earth, let tomorrow become a friend<br />
Show love to your fellow man<br />
And you will have honesty in return<br />
Let big and small share the same table<br />
In a friendship which is alive and growing</p>
<p>Give us a dawn with children&#8217;s laughter and song<br />
We love our father and mother, we have love to give to our sister and brother<br />
Give us a sunrise and let our dream be true<br />
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hand</p>
<p>(Give us a dawn with children&#8217;s laughter and song)<br />
(We love our father and mother, we have love to give to our sister and brother)<br />
Give us a sunrise and let our dream be true<br />
Together on the path of hope we walk hand in hand<br />
