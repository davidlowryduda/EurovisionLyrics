Doubts and uncertainties<br />
Often cause me troubles<br />
Will you and I fly on the wings of love<br />
Or will everything remain as they are?</p>
<p>The answers are in the air<br />
But yet I hesitate</p>
<p>No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide<br />
Awake or asleep, you&#8217;re constantly on my mind<br />
No or yes? Off or on? It&#8217;s difficult to find the answer<br />
Though I believe I&#8217;ll find it with you</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll spin me a web of adventure, mmm&#8230;<br />
If we ever become one<br />
Still, it&#8217;s impossible to foresee<br />
The end of the tale and the answers</p>
<p>No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide<br />
Awake or asleep, you&#8217;re constantly on my mind<br />
No or yes? Off or on? It&#8217;s difficult to find the answer<br />
Though I believe I&#8217;ll find it with you</p>
<p>My mind goes back and forth<br />
I&#8217;m bewitched, yet still hesitant</p>
<p>No or&#8230;<br />
No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide<br />
Awake or asleep, you&#8217;re constantly on my mind<br />
No or yes? Off or on? It&#8217;s difficult to find the answer<br />
Though I believe I&#8217;ll find it with you</p>
<p>No or yes? Now or then? I will never decide<br />
Awake or asleep, you&#8217;re constantly on my mind<br />
No or yes? Off or on? It&#8217;s difficult to find the answer<br />
Still I expect to find it</p>
<p>Expect to find it<br />
Expect to find it with you, with you</p>
<p>No or yes?<br />
