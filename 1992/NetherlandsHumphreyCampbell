I searched for myself<br />
In books and in far-away countries<br />
That&#8217;s my life<br />
But no matter how far you search<br />
Nobody holds the truth</p>
<p>Show me the way to the new country<br />
Show me the way, take me by the hand<br />
Show me the way to people around me</p>
<p>Teach me to see that it can be done otherwise<br />
And moreover with a better plan<br />
Show me the way, the way for everyone</p>
<p>I searched for myself, here and in other countries<br />
And have been in search of friends for eternity (hohoho)<br />
I found the truth, but I&#8217;ve seen it stranding again<br />
The stupid dreams, stolen by the time (hohoho)</p>
<p>What is this life? How far can you go?<br />
Which one can help you? Feeling or reason?<br />
The way you search for in yourself<br />
Never stops, never stands still, lets you live</p>
<p>Show me the way to my own sense<br />
Show me the way to a new beginning<br />
Show me the way to love for always</p>
<p>Show me the way<br />
Oh, oh, walk along</p>
<p>Show me the way<br />
Show me the way<br />
Show me the way<br />
