In sweatshirt, in trousers, crazy generation<br />
We hide our emotions underneath the skin of a jacket<br />
Yes, but underneath the appearance, but behind the carefreeness<br />
We say nothing about our injuries, my generation assures</p>
<p>In rap and in funky, generation Gorby<br />
We hide our shivers underneath tons of concrete<br />
But that look of carefreeness is nothing but an appearance<br />
In the land without borders, my generation hopes</p>
<p>We want violins and statues of stone<br />
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air<br />
We want violins, birds, phantasms<br />
And declarations that can&#8217;t be changed<br />
We want violins</p>
<p>We have no history, no past, no memory<br />
My heart pounds underneath my smile-for-the-show<br />
I show the indifference, it&#8217;s nothing but an appearance<br />
Underneath those coloured masks, my generation is afraid</p>
<p>We want violins and statues of stone<br />
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air<br />
We want violins, birds, phantasms<br />
And declarations that can&#8217;t be changed<br />
We want violins</p>
<p>We want violins, we want a whole orchestra<br />
And afterwards emotions, and afterwards drunken nights<br />
We want violins</p>
<p>We want violins and statues of stone<br />
Thousand years of tradition, feelings in the air<br />
We want violins, birds, phantasms<br />
And declarations that can&#8217;t be changed<br />
We want violins</p>
<p>We want violins<br />
We want violins<br />
We want violins<br />
