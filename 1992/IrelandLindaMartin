<p>Sometimes I watch you passing by my window<br />
And sometimes I watch you passing through my dreams<br />
And sometimes, when I look at you<br />
You take my breath away</p>
<p>Sometimes I try and understand your reasons<br />
You choose to feel the way you feel about me<br />
And sometimes, when I turn around<br />
And you&#8217;re there, like today<br />
I wanna say:</p>
<p>Why me?<br />
I look at you and I get to feeling, why me? (Why me? Ooh&#8230;)<br />
I know it&#8217;s true but I can&#8217;t believe it<br />
I keep on wonderin&#8217; why my love shines in your eyes</p>
<p>Why me?<br />
I look at you and I ask myself, why me?</p>
<p>Sometimes I lie awake and watch you sleeping<br />
And listen to the beating of your heart<br />
And sometimes, when you&#8217;re lyin&#8217; there<br />
You take my breath away<br />
And I wanna say</p>
<p>Why me?<br />
I look at you and I get to feeling, why me? (Why me? Ooh&#8230;)<br />
I know it&#8217;s true but I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s me<br />
Who&#8217;s gonna be holdin&#8217; you in my arms tonight<br />
And why it&#8217;s me who&#8217;s gonna be the one to make you feel all right tonight</p>
<p>Why me?<br />
I look at you and I get to feeling, why me? (Why me? Ooh&#8230;)<br />
I know it&#8217;s true but I can&#8217;t believe it<br />
I keep on wonderin&#8217; why my love shines in your eyes</p>
<p>Why me?<br />
I look at you and I ask myself, why me?<br />
Why me?</p>
