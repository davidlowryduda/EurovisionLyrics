My friend got angry, he&#8217;s gone home<br />
So just like me you&#8217;re alone at the party?<br />
I know him, there&#8217;s no chance left<br />
Then you&#8217;re free tonight, I take it</p>
<p>Now tell me, do you think I&#8217;m a girl<br />
Who&#8217;d fall for anybody?<br />
I knew you&#8217;d say that<br />
So why do we stay here?</p>
<p>When all the things that nobody sees<br />
Nobody minds that, no thanks, I&#8217;ll stay here<br />
All the things that nobody knows<br />
That can&#8217;t be any of their business, you see?</p>
<p>Yes, all the things that nobody sees<br />
Nobody minds that, a break is OK<br />
If it&#8217;s for love<br />
And if we&#8217;re the only ones who know</p>
<p>What do you say, do you just think we should leave?<br />
Give me a reason why we shouldn&#8217;t do it<br />
Just a moment, while I put on my coat<br />
It&#8217;s all about daring, while you dare it</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll take a taxi, while we can get one<br />
Without sensing time and place<br />
Is it illegal to aim at<br />
An hour for love?</p>
<p>When all the things that nobody sees<br />
Nobody minds that, like this affair<br />
All the things that nobody knows<br />
That can&#8217;t be any of their business</p>
<p>What do we do, if someone sees us leave the party?<br />
Yes, by the way<br />
I know a trick that won&#8217;t disgrace us:<br />
We&#8217;ve left, because you&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>A drop more than you should have<br />
Don&#8217;t give me that<br />
Now I&#8217;ll find a door to use<br />
So nobody will see that we&#8217;re on our way</p>
<p>For, all the things that nobody sees<br />
Nobody minds that, like this affair<br />
All the things that nobody knows<br />
That can&#8217;t be any of their business</p>
<p>You know that, all the things that nobody sees<br />
Nobody minds that, a break is OK<br />
Lightning can easily strike<br />
We&#8217;re only a second away from love<br />
