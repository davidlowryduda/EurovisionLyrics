One day the old lovers meet in a bar<br />
Deceitful but sincere telling how it goes<br />
It was raining outside and they were there<br />
Thinking about who knows where, who knows, because it&#8217;s over</p>
<p>One day the old lovers tell each other their ages<br />
Sweet resentments and other truth</p>
<p>Who are we, feeling lost?<br />
So different from the heroes in our movie<br />
With the irony and a bit of trouble<br />
In this immense rhapsody, now about us</p>
<p>But one day the old lovers long for more<br />
Dreams and desires of another youth<br />
And they leave their families, betray their friends<br />
They don&#8217;t want advice about how to be happy</p>
<p>And when the old lovers leave each other at the bar<br />
They will become songs of a time far behind</p>
<p>Who are we, sitting here?<br />
Listening to a story of a life that didn&#8217;t work out<br />
Who are we, sunk in shame<br />
For this immense and hopeless rhapsody</p>
<p>Oh who are we, sunk in shame<br />
For this immense and hopeless rhapsody<br />
