What can I say about everything that is changing around me?<br />
What will it mean for me the future?<br />
My children&#8217;s questions frighten me<br />
The answers that I give them are not enough</p>
<p>Let my song&#8217;s melody<br />
Be the compass to the journey<br />
I found the answer in love<br />
And the whole light of spring<br />
And all the hope in the world</p>
<p>What can I say about where I came from and where I&#8217;m going to?<br />
What is this that makes me go crazy?<br />
Find for a solution for everything that I love<br />
To make me feel secure on the ground I walk on</p>
<p>Let my song&#8217;s melody<br />
Be the compass to the journey<br />
I found the answer in love<br />
And the whole light of spring<br />
And all the hope in the world</p>
<p>Let my song&#8217;s melody<br />
Be the compass to the journey<br />
I found the answer in love<br />
And the whole light of spring<br />
And all the hope in the world<br />
