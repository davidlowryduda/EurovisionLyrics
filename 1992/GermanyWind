Do you see the young girl on the platform over there?<br />
She thinks that one of the trains will lead to freedom<br />
And a man who lost his job dreams of showing everyone<br />
That he rises like a phoenix from the ashes</p>
<p>Dreams are there for everyone<br />
Believe in them and hold them tight, with heart, with body and soul<br />
Tomorrow is a new day<br />
Fight for your dreams, then they will come true</p>
<p>The old man over there who once was rich now falls asleep under bridges<br />
A woman thinks about a child, and doesn&#8217;t realise that she&#8217;s crying<br />
The boy who is running away with an unknown destination<br />
They&#8217;re all yearning for feelings</p>
<p>Dreams are there for everyone<br />
Believe in them and hold them tight, with heart, with body and your soul<br />
Tomorrow is a new day<br />
Fight for your dreams, then they will come true</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never really too late, it&#8217;s never really over<br />
Sometimes a dream can be a new beginning</p>
<p>Dreams are there for everyone (Dreams are there for everyone)<br />
Believe in them and hold them tight, with heart, with body and your soul<br />
Tomorrow is a new day (Tomorrow is a new day)<br />
Fight for your dreams, then they will come true<br />
