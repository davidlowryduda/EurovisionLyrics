There is a girl, that I go to see sometimes<br />
She likes me, because I&#8217;ll always do my best<br />
She has a silence and there&#8217;s so much I want to know<br />
So I&#8217;ll stay the whole night, even though we&#8217;re like water and fire</p>
<p>(Come) as long as the heart is beating<br />
(Come) as long as there is excitement<br />
Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p>(Come) as long as the sun shines<br />
(Come) as long as lust is giving and taking<br />
And when everything is gone<br />
Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p>She paints pictures, that I&#8217;ve never seen<br />
She sings her songs, when nobody is sitting next to her<br />
In her eyes there is a longing for more<br />
So I&#8217;ll stay the whole night, even though we&#8217;re like water and fire</p>
<p>(Come) as long as the heart is beating<br />
(Come) as long as there is excitement<br />
Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p>(Come) as long as the sun shines<br />
(Come) as long as lust is giving and taking<br />
And when everything is gone<br />
Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p>Time is like a hourglass in your hand<br />
Where seconds and minutes turn into years<br />
I want everything I get</p>
<p>(Come) as long as the heart is beating<br />
(Come) as long as there is excitement<br />
Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p>(Come) as long as the sun shines<br />
(Come) as long as lust is giving and taking<br />
And when everything is gone<br />
Tomorrow is another day</p>
<p>Tomorrow is another day<br />
