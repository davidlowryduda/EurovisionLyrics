We were a real conspired team<br />
Were always hardened against the wind<br />
I thought that we<br />
Would never get off the way</p>
<p>What we had, was like an Odyssey<br />
With you again, I&#8217;ll be glad to&#8230;</p>
<p>A ship, that was so full of love<br />
Sails badly on its own<br />
I&#8217;m frightened to be out there, now<br />
To be totally without you</p>
<p>I wonder, how that can die<br />
Do you maybe, with me again, want to&#8230;</p>
<p>Go together to the horizon?<br />
Together with you, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>together strong</em></font><br />
Go together, so far with you<br />
For two people who love each other so much, waiting is still too much</p>
<p>No ocean was too big for us<br />
No dawn was too far away<br />
I thought you&#8217;d never let me go<br />
After such a long time</p>
<p>Your farewell hurts deep inside of me<br />
But maybe tomorrow we will&#8230;</p>
<p>Go together to the horizon<br />
Together with you, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>together strong</em></font><br />
Go together, so far with you<br />
For two people who love each other so much, waiting is still too much</p>
<p>Go together to the horizon<br />
Together with you, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>together strong</em></font><br />
Go together, so far with you<br />
For two people who love each other so much, waiting is still too much</p>
<p>Go together<br />
