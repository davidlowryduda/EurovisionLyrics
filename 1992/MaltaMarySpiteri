<p>Little child, your look &#8211; it pains me<br />
It&#8217;s an answer your eyes seek<br />
Can&#8217;t you see what shadow of a soul<br />
I&#8217;ve come to be tired of the scene</p>
<p>Little child, come sit beside me<br />
It&#8217;s so much I have to say<br />
Stay as free as high winds on the seas<br />
No destiny bringin&#8217; lonely tears</p>
<p>Smile, live today, and leave the past behind<br />
Live it up day by day, and surely you may find<br />
That both sorrow and tomorrow aren&#8217;t worth a thought or two<br />
Look at me and teach me to live again</p>
<p>Little child, your look elates me<br />
It&#8217;s an answer your eyes give<br />
Now, you see, I&#8217;m on the road again<br />
I&#8217;m bringin&#8217; out what child there&#8217;s in me</p>
<p>Smile, live today, and leave the past behind<br />
Live it up day by day, and surely you may find<br />
That both sorrow and tomorrow aren&#8217;t worth a thought or two<br />
Look at me and teach me to live again<br />
Live again</p>
<p>Sing, live today, this moment can&#8217;t endure<br />
Oh, let us reach for the stars &#8211; we&#8217;ll make it, I&#8217;m that sure<br />
Be it sadness, be it gladness, we can start it all anew<br />
Look at me, look at me, and the sun comes shining through</p>
