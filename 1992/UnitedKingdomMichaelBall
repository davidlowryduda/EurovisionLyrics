<p>(One step out of time)<br />
Ooh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Another week, another day<br />
When I call you&#8217;re miles away<br />
In the arms of another</p>
<p>All my friends say I&#8217;m crazy<br />
Night after night I&#8217;m waitin&#8217;<br />
You say that I&#8217;m wrong<br />
Then you tell me that I&#8217;m comin&#8217; on too strong</p>
<p>One step out of time<br />
One reason to put this love on the line again<br />
Can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s true<br />
Now I&#8217;m one step out of time</p>
<p>(One step, one step out of time)<br />
(One step, one step out of time)</p>
<p>When I sleep I dream of you<br />
You&#8217;re in my mind in everything I do<br />
Well, I still don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s over</p>
<p>I know what&#8217;s right<br />
I could be with you holdin&#8217; you tight<br />
Now that you&#8217;re gone<br />
Won&#8217;t you tell me where I&#8217;ve been goin&#8217; wrong?</p>
<p>One step out of time<br />
One reason to put this love on the line again<br />
Can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s true<br />
Now I&#8217;m one step out of time</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t walk away, just let your heart decide<br />
That love is gonna stay<br />
I know it&#8217;s right, just think about it girl<br />
Ooh&#8230; for a while</p>
<p>Another week, another day<br />
When I call you&#8217;re miles away<br />
And I still don&#8217;t feel that it&#8217;s over</p>
<p>(One step out of time)<br />
One reason to put this love on the line again<br />
Can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s true<br />
Now I&#8217;m one step out of time</p>
<p>(One step, one step out of time)<br />
(One step, one step out of time)<br />
One step, one step out of time<br />
One step out of time</p>
