A golden rose, September, a last kiss of the sun<br />
A blackbird whistles full of nostalgia the refrain of a season<br />
Still the summer will sing a deeply moving song<br />
That will softly fade away, only sadness will remain for us</p>
<p>The days are slowing down and sliding over<br />
The summer is getting tired, oh, so tired<br />
Now we have to part, our heart is getting quiet and fragile<br />
When we see it blooming again, September, golden rose</p>
<p>As soon as the first leaves are falling in the woods<br />
A red ivy shackles to a window<br />
When evening mists hang in the valleys<br />
Then I know that summer is over</p>
<p>But before it leaves, it will linger for a moment<br />
As if it wants to pay the farewell with&#8230;</p>
<p>A golden rose, September, a last kiss of the sun<br />
A blackbird whistles full of nostalgia the refrain of a season<br />
Still the summer will sing a deeply moving song<br />
That will softly fade away, only sadness will remain for us</p>
<p>The days are slowing down and sliding over<br />
The summer is getting tired, oh, so tired<br />
Now we have to part, our heart is getting quiet and fragile<br />
When we see blooming again, September, golden rose</p>
<p>September, golden rose<br />
