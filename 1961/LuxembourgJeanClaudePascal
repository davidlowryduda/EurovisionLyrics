We, the lovers &#8211; they want to separate us<br />
They would like to prevent us from being happy<br />
We, the lovers &#8211; it seems that it&#8217;s hell<br />
That watches us or else the iron and the fire</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true, the idiots and the evil ones<br />
Harm us, do bad things to us<br />
However nothing is more obvious than love<br />
We, the lovers, we can do nothing against them<br />
They are a thousand and we are two, the lovers</p>
<p>But the hour is going to ring on the least difficult nights<br />
And I could love you without them talking about it downtown<br />
It&#8217;s promised, it&#8217;s written down</p>
<p>We, the lovers &#8211; the sun shines for us<br />
And we sleep on the knees of the Good Lord<br />
We, the lovers &#8211; He gave us the right<br />
To be happy and to be joyful together</p>
<p>Then, the without-loves, the mis-loved<br />
It will be necessary that we pay back<br />
Those who have never been condemned<br />
We, the lovers, we&#8217;re going to live without you<br />
For the sky is with us, the lovers<br />
