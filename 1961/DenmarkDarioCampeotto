You are so wonderful, Angelique<br />
What are the stars compared to your pretty eyes?<br />
Your voice sounds like the sweetest music<br />
And your soul is made of dream and romance</p>
<p>If I wore Shakespeare&#8217;s poetry hat<br />
I&#8217;d be writing poems to you day and night<br />
And if I wore Caruso&#8217;s cape<br />
Then I&#8217;d sing and sing for you</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d paint you lovely and bashful<br />
If I could paint as Rembrandt could<br />
And I&#8217;d worship you on a violin<br />
If I could play like Menuhin</p>
<p>But all the muses said no<br />
I don&#8217;t master singing and string playing<br />
Just let me dream a little of you<br />
Angelique, so I feel<br />
As just a single little pawn in the mosaic of you life</p>
<p>Around the world there are wonderful girls<br />
Some have the soft, and some have the fiery look<br />
But if I searched in all of the most wonderful countries<br />
I&#8217;d never find anyone so beautiful as you, Angelique</p>
<p>If I wore Shakespeare&#8217;s poetry hat<br />
I&#8217;d be writing poems to you day and night<br />
And if I wore Caruso&#8217;s cape<br />
Then I&#8217;d sing and sing for you</p>
<p>And I&#8217;d paint you lovely and bashful<br />
If I could paint as Rembrandt could<br />
And I&#8217;d worship you on a violin<br />
If I could play like Menuhin</p>
<p>But all the muses said no<br />
I don&#8217;t master singing and string playing<br />
Just let me dream a little of you<br />
Angelique, so I feel<br />
As just a single little pawn in the mosaic of you life</p>
<p>Angelique, you, my wonderful Angelique<br />
My Angelique<br />
