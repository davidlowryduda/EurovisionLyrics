I became your friend and whispered &#8220;darling&#8221;<br />
Your only answer was &#8220;yes, yes&#8221;<br />
Waves beat against the shore, the sun is on fire<br />
Summer at Palma beach</p>
<p>Say &#8220;my love&#8221;, be my love<br />
Can you see the palms trembling, seabirds hovering<br />
All in sweet harmony?</p>
<p>Say &#8220;my love&#8221;, be my love<br />
Hear the guitars play our melody<br />
The prayer of night: come to me, darling</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand your language, it&#8217;s like music<br />
But I understand the looks you are sending<br />
Let me once again hear its tone<br />
Listen to the song of the south</p>
<p>Say &#8220;my love&#8221;, be my love<br />
Can you see the palms trembling, seabirds hovering<br />
All in sweet harmony?</p>
<p>Be my love, say &#8220;my love&#8221;<br />
Hear the guitars play our melody<br />
The prayer of night: come to me, darling<br />
</div>
