<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Everywhere in the world the departure is difficult<br />
And sometimes the heart hurts<br />
All words that you say, you don&#8217;t believe them yourself anymore<br />
Have a nice life, goodbye</p>
<p>Another smile – a kiss<br />
Another wave – a greeting<br />
And a ship goes out and with it goes luck<br />
Yet hope remains</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see each other once again<br />
And maybe already next year<br />
We&#8217;ll see each other once again<br />
Then everything will be as it used to be</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I believe in our love<br />
No matter what may happen<br />
Somewhere, some day, always remember<br />
We&#8217;ll see each other again</p>
<p>And the Sunday was grey, and the sky was heavy<br />
And the rain hammered on the roof<br />
And as you walked along the street down to the sea<br />
I was watching you from my window</p>
<p>So much love – gone<br />
So many dreams – gone<br />
I don&#8217;t know where you are<br />
But your last words still ring in my heart</p>
<p>Far, further than the end of the world<br />
My love is close to you<br />
And my straying heart<br />
Will never beat for anyone but you</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I believe in our love<br />
No matter what may happen<br />
Always remember: somewhere, some day<br />
We&#8217;ll see each other again</p>
<p>Always remember: somewhere, some day<br />
We&#8217;ll see each other again<br />
