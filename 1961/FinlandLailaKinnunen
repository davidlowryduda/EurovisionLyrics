The gown of the night has covered the land<br />
Time has come to turn off the lights<br />
Only the shadows stay seriously still<br />
And begin to dream</p>
<p>A small window is still lit<br />
Who is awake, accompanied by her thoughts?<br />
Longing for her friend<br />
She is singing and hoping:</p>
<p>A path of rays of light leads me into memories<br />
The lantern burns forever, the memory never fades<br />
Through the silent night all the way behind the stars<br />
She sings a song for him, if he can hear it</p>
<p>A beautiful new star has lit up<br />
The singer notices its shine as well<br />
Now the loved one lit his window<br />
He hears me while he is longing</p>
<p>The light is disguised by the rising dawn<br />
The singer has fallen asleep<br />
She flies to her friend<br />
On the wings of dreams<br />
