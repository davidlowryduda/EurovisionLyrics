I have a thousand stars and I have the moon and the sun<br />
And the light of your glance, and the light of your glance within my heart<br />
I have the clouds of the sky and the waves of the sea<br />
And if I have your loving, and if I have your loving, I don&#8217;t want anything else</p>
<p>Being with you, with you, with you, it suddenly makes me feel happy<br />
And when I look at you, look at you, look at you I forget the world and myself<br />
It&#8217;s wonderful to love you that way<br />
Being with you, with you, with you makes me feel happy</p>
<p>When it dawns and it&#8217;s snowing I can&#8217;t feel the lack of sunshine<br />
And the snow flakes, and the snow flakes seem colourful<br />
When the evening is over and everything starts to be grey<br />
My path lights up, my path lights up if you look at me again</p>
<p>Being with you, with you, with you, it suddenly makes me feel happy<br />
And when I look at you, look at you, look at you I forget the world and myself<br />
It&#8217;s wonderful to love you that way<br />
Being with you, with you, with you makes me feel happy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s wonderful to love you that way<br />
Being with you, with you, with you<br />
Talking to you, to you, to you<br />
Dreaming of you, of you, of you I feel happy<br />
Happy!<br />
