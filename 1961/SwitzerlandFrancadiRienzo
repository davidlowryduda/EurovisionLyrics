Tomorrow we&#8217;ll have<br />
Gardens for picking bouquets of dreams<br />
Tomorrow we&#8217;ll have<br />
A morning for smiling to the rising sun</p>
<p>Tomorrow we could<br />
In the same house, prepare silently<br />
The cradle of luck that we&#8217;ll have tomorrow</p>
<p>You complain about living in a house without lights<br />
You don&#8217;t have a Sunday and I don&#8217;t have a ceiling<br />
When I leave in the morning my outskirt without lights<br />
In another district, you go back to home</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&#8217;ll have<br />
Less time for killing, less lonely nights<br />
Tomorrow we&#8217;ll go<br />
To the woods for lying down or jumping the rivers</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&#8217;ll have<br />
Friends who will come without being illuminated by the moon<br />
And onto the luck that we&#8217;ll have tomorrow</p>
<p>You tell me that time slows down every day<br />
You tell me that tomorrow is too late for coming<br />
We&#8217;ll never live in Spanish castles<br />
But, my darling, do we have to refuse to build one?</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&#8217;ll have<br />
Less time for killing, less lonely nights<br />
Tomorrow we&#8217;ll go<br />
To the woods for lying down or jumping the rivers</p>
<p>Tomorrow we&#8217;ll have<br />
Friends who will come without being illuminated by the moon<br />
And onto the luck that we&#8217;ll have tomorrow</p>
<p>That we&#8217;ll have tomorrow<br />
That we&#8217;ll have tomorrow<br />
