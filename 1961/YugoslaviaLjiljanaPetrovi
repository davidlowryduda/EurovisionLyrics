The old road is covered with yellow leaves<br />
That road is dark<br />
The dreams are covered with yellow stars<br />
The dreams in my eye</p>
<p>Yes, I know, I know<br />
I still remember those days<br />
You were with me then</p>
<p>Yes, I know that you&#8217;re still mine<br />
The branches are crying tonight<br />
In my eyes and my dreams</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still expecting your smile<br />
And your hand<br />
While I&#8217;m waiting, I&#8217;m quiet<br />
And going to sleep</p>
<p>Yes, I know that you&#8217;re still mine<br />
The branches are crying tonight<br />
In my eyes and my dreams</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still expecting your smile<br />
And your hand<br />
While I&#8217;m waiting, I&#8217;m quiet<br />
And going to sleep</p>
<p>Yes, I know that you&#8217;re still mine<br />
The branches are crying tonight<br />
In my eyes, in my heart<br />
In my loneliness and my dreams<br />
