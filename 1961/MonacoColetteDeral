Let&#8217;s go children, today life is beautiful<br />
With a feeling of pride, I tell you the news<br />
It isn&#8217;t the day of glory, of victory or New Year&#8217;s Day<br />
It&#8217;s the day of spring</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go children, open wide your ears<br />
Listen to the song of the awaking streams<br />
And you others &#8211; the clouds, be obedient and go on<br />
It&#8217;s the day of spring</p>
<p>Live, we are about to live<br />
Freely like the wind<br />
Rich, we are rich<br />
Of a thousand promises, of youth and of good weather</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go children, prisoners of the towns<br />
The sky, good child, offers you its fields of stars<br />
It&#8217;s sufficient to choose one, there&#8217;s a fortune hidden in it<br />
It&#8217;s the day of spring</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go children, today life is beautiful<br />
With a feeling of pride, I tell you the news<br />
For me it&#8217;s the day of glory, of victory<br />
This day of spring, it&#8217;s love that is awaiting me</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go my love, I only dream of foam<br />
The first beautiful days, it seems so soft<br />
That&#8217;s why I proposed you something<br />
Go in the fields, see if the wolf is there</p>
<p>Live, I want to live<br />
Freely under the blue sky<br />
Rich, I feel rich<br />
Of love and of fresh water that I fished in your eyes</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go children, today life is beautiful<br />
On the field they just have to spread the news<br />
A beautiful white page, all white, is opened now<br />
It&#8217;s the day of spring</p>
<p>Love, love, love is waiting for us<br />
