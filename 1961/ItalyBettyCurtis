I didn&#8217;t believe it was possible that these words could be said:</p>
<p>Beyond the most precious good, there is you<br />
Beyond the most ambitious dream, there is you<br />
Beyond the most beautiful things<br />
Beyond the stars, there is you<br />
Beyond, there is you for me, for me, only for me</p>
<p>Beyond the deepest sea, there is you<br />
Beyond the borders of the world, there is you<br />
Beyond the endless circle<br />
Beyond the life, there is you<br />
Beyond, there is you for me</p>
<p>There is you (There is you)<br />
Beyond the most beautiful things<br />
Beyond the stars, there is you<br />
Beyond, there is you for me, for me, only for me</p>
<p>Beyond the deepest ocean, there is you<br />
Beyond the borders of the world, there is you<br />
Beyond the endless circle<br />
Beyond life, there is you<br />
Beyond, there is you for me</p>
<p>Beyond<br />
