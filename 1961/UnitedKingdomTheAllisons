<p>Goodbye (goodbye), farewell (farewell)<br />
I&#8217;m not sure what to do<br />
So long (so long), au revoir (au revoir)<br />
It&#8217;s hard, but I&#8217;ll pull through</p>
<p>Are you sure you won&#8217;t be sorry?<br />
Comes tomorrow, you won&#8217;t want me<br />
Back again to hold you tightly?</p>
<p>Now are you sure it&#8217;s not your foolish heart?<br />
That you won&#8217;t grieve if we&#8217;re to be apart?</p>
<p>You will see, as time goes by<br />
We&#8217;ll grow lonely &#8211; you and I<br />
Dreaming of each other and we&#8217;ll cry</p>
<p>Goodbye (goodbye), farewell (farewell)<br />
I&#8217;m not sure what to do<br />
So long (so long), au revoir (au revoir)<br />
It&#8217;s hard, but I&#8217;ll pull through</p>
<p>Are you sure you won&#8217;t be sorry?<br />
Comes tomorrow, you won&#8217;t want me<br />
Back again to hold you tightly?</p>
<p>Just stop and think<br />
It&#8217;s your decision now<br />
For you&#8217;re the one<br />
Who went and broke the vow</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be sorry, wait and see<br />
Spend your life in misery<br />
Wishing that you had returned to me</p>
<p>Goodbye (goodbye), farewell (farewell)<br />
What is there to live for?<br />
Before you go<br />
Just think now, are you sure?</p>
<p>Are you sure you won&#8217;t be sorry?<br />
Comes tomorrow, you won&#8217;t want me<br />
Back again to hold you tightly in my arms?</p>
