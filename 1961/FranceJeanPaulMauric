Ding and dong and ding and dong, listen in the light air to<br />
Just four notes going for a walk<br />
Ding and dong and ding and dong running by mounts and valleys<br />
They delight the amazed nature with songs</p>
<p>Springtime, springtime, April rings<br />
The marmot wakes up at the first sun<br />
Springtime, springtime, the bees buzz<br />
While all the leafbuds open their homes</p>
<p>The hedgehog sharpens its not-so-nasty quills<br />
The finch plays the flute, flying happily<br />
Springtime, springtime, the wind swirls<br />
Sowing butterflies on every bush</p>
<p>Ding and dong and ding and dong in the shadow of the forest<br />
The spider pulls the bells of the lily-of-the-valley with the end of his thread<br />
Ding and dong and ding and dong, all dancing like a fool<br />
The winding stream plays with the pebbles</p>
<p>Springtime, springtime, April rings<br />
Mr Badger who slept, goes out to take some fresh air<br />
Springtime, springtime, the touchy look<br />
The snail comes to get drunk of a dewdrop</p>
<p>And the ant worries, she has run out of provisions<br />
But the cicada is getting ready for making a song<br />
Springtime, springtime, on the freezing water<br />
A big leaf of water lily pampers tadpoles</p>
<p>Springtime, springtime, April rings<br />
The squirrel plays hide-and-seek behind his bushy tail<br />
Springtime, springtime, the toad is on the go<br />
Looking at himself in a water pool, he thinks he&#8217;s very beautiful</p>
<p>And the turtle travels, all wedding guests are waiting for her<br />
At the beautiful marriage of two turtledoves<br />
Springtime, springtime, April rings<br />
And when I hear it, I have a satisfied heart</p>
<p>I have a satisfied heart<br />
I have a satisfied heart<br />
