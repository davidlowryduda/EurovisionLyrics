This will be a<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-a-ding day<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day</p>
<p>When I feel like singing out loud<br />
Jumping through the house and the streets<br />
When a street musician, very elegantly<br />
Bows to me with hat in hand</p>
<p>When I feel like drinking vodka in the morning<br />
And clinking spontaneously with the baker<br />
Well, then it&#8217;s no question:<br />
Today will be again a day without one dissonance</p>
<p>This will be a<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-a-ding day<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day</p>
<p>When I laugh about a hand full of blanks<br />
And when I want to shoot the weathercock off the tower<br />
With a water cannon, in a balloon<br />
When I float through the air and frolick with the sun</p>
<p>When I feel that I can party for hours<br />
And exchange the less for the most<br />
Now, then it&#8217;s no question<br />
Today I make a bid for a big carillon</p>
<p>This will be a<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-a-ding day<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m going to call a minister<br />
To tell the joke of the day<br />
When I dance, when I swing, ask for noise<br />
Well, then I found my niche</p>
<p>When I want to hire a beat group for the evening<br />
For a solemn dinner with the neighbours<br />
When everyone laughs then, I&#8217;ll say tonight:<br />
&#8220;This day was again endlessly fine&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-a-ding day<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day</p>
<p>This was a<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-a-ding day<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding day<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding<br />
Ring ding-a-ding-a-ding day<br />
