No need to cry, little Anouschka<br />
He&#8217;ll come back, little Anouschka<br />
When spring comes and the flowers bloom<br />
He&#8217;ll be back with you</p>
<p>Your eyes, little Anouschka<br />
Are full of tears, little Anouschka<br />
But the world is big, the time passes by<br />
And tears will be dried by the wind</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s true love<br />
Everything will turn out fine<br />
Then he will come back<br />
Because he&#8217;s thinking of you, always of you</p>
<p>Anouschka<br />
So much joy, little Anouschka<br />
You will have, little Anouschka<br />
When spring comes and the flowers bloom<br />
Your lives will begin</p>
<p>Lalalala lalalala&#8230;<br />
Lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Then he will come back<br />
Because he&#8217;s thinking of you, always of you<br />
Of you<br />
</div>
