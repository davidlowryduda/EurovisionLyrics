A shot just to salute<br />
And to say goodbye and off he went into night<br />
Buried in the middle of the grass, he lies here<br />
Where he fell down without a word on his lips</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for spring<br />
I can sense the tender palms of my dear<br />
I feel the caress of my hair and some words<br />
Without words among the grass<br />
When the spring is here</p>
<p>Why does the sound of the trumpet reminds me of those<br />
Who don&#8217;t have the right words in their mouths?</p>
<p>Why do all these flowers<br />
Lie and fester in the middle of the field?<br />
So that all these people would anticipate the time<br />
And the spring that for all comes<br />
Only once<br />
</div>
