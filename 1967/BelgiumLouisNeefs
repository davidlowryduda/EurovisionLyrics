Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much<br />
Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much</p>
<p>She was as beautiful, beautiful as a spring song<br />
She couldn&#8217;t be more beautiful<br />
She was as beautiful, beautiful as one seldom sees<br />
And there was moonlight, mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much</p>
<p>Her first kiss, kiss, it came just in time<br />
Oh oh oh, what a kiss<br />
And then I thought, let&#8217;s do this glory<br />
One time again, mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much</p>
<p>Somewhere far away, far away in a pine<br />
That nightingale was singing<br />
And it braught to me my dearest dream<br />
And that dream was fatal to me, mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much<br />
Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much</p>
<p>Oh oh, I have worries, oh oh, I have worries<br />
Oh oh, I have worries and that bothers me so much<br />
