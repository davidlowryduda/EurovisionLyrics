Listen, listen: the wind changed and she didn&#8217;t return<br />
The birds flew away, the leaves fell on the ground</p>
<p>She wanted to live and travel around the world<br />
She promised to return if the wind changed</p>
<p>And the wind changed and she didn&#8217;t return<br />
I know that she lied, and ran away forever<br />
Wind, if you can, bring me back her love<br />
Because I&#8217;m going to die, without her by my side</p>
<p>Clouds, have mercy with this lonely me<br />
Knock on her window, cry over her</p>
<p>And the clouds have cried, and when they came back<br />
I knew that she lied, and ran away forever<br />
Clouds, please cover my pain<br />
Because I&#8217;m going to die, without her by my side</p>
<p>Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen!<br />
