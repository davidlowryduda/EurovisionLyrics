Let&#8217;s talk about love one more time<br />
It&#8217;s all the truth in our life<br />
Let&#8217;s stop the hours and the days for a moment<br />
And let&#8217;s talk about love one more time</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about my love and about your love<br />
About the first time we looked to each other<br />
Give me your hands and let&#8217;s talk together in the shadow<br />
About love one more time</p>
<p>What does it matter? What does it matter?<br />
All those people that look at the earth<br />
And see nothing more but earth</p>
<p>What does it matter? What does it matter?<br />
All those people coming and going<br />
Along the world without seeing the truth</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about my love and about your love<br />
About the first time that we looked to each other<br />
Give me your hands and let&#8217;s talk together in the shadow<br />
About love one more time</p>
<p>What does it matter? What does it matter?<br />
All those people that look at the earth<br />
And see nothing more but earth</p>
<p>What does it matter? What does it matter?<br />
All those people coming and going<br />
Along the world without seeing&#8230;</p>
<p>What does it matter? Let&#8217;s not pay attention to anyone<br />
And let&#8217;s talk about love, about our love<br />
