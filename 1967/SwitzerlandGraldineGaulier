Quel c≈ìur vas-tu briser<br />
Now that mine stopped beating for you?<br />
Which heart are you going to break?<br />
Since I have nothing anymore, nothing from you but words without voice</p>
<p>Which heart are you going to break<br />
Giving him the hope of a dream life for two?<br />
Which heart are you going to break<br />
Making him believe that only you can make him happy?<br />
Happy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy to make believe<br />
The roads seeded with flowers<br />
Above all since we spoke to our heart<br />
That asks us only to believe in it</p>
<p>Which heart are you going to break<br />
Now that mine believes in nothing anymore, neither in you?<br />
Which heart are you going to break<br />
Just for vain pleasure of feeling that he lives under your law?</p>
<p>What heart are you going to break<br />
Following your road, believing that you live your life?<br />
What heart are you going to break<br />
Throughout your life?<br />
Yours, yours, yours<br />
