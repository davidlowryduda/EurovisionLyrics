My love, my love, don&#8217;t go far away anymore<br />
The world is not the one from your dreams<br />
People are not as you think</p>
<p>My love, my love, don&#8217;t go far away anymore<br />
And hold my hands to understand<br />
That I can cry for you</p>
<p>In your countryside, the earth is always damp of mist<br />
And people are all the same<br />
They don&#8217;t have as many dreams as you have</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve watched them, they even don&#8217;t have bread for living<br />
They don&#8217;t have anything, but they know how to love<br />
And now they&#8217;re richer than you</p>
<p>My love, my love, don&#8217;t go far away anymore<br />
The world is not the one from your dreams<br />
People are not as you think</p>
<p>My love, my love, don&#8217;t go far away anymore<br />
And hold my hands to understand<br />
That I can cry for you</p>
<p>My love</p>
<p>My love, my love, don&#8217;t go far away anymore<br />
And hold my hands to understand<br />
That I can cry for you<br />
My love, my love, my love<br />
