Sweet, sweet, love is sweet<br />
Sweet is my life, my life in your arms<br />
Sweet, sweet, love is sweet<br />
Sweet is my life, my life close to you</p>
<p>Blue, blue, love is blue<br />
Cradle my heart, my loving heart<br />
Blue, blue, love is blue<br />
Blue like the sky which play in your eyes</p>
<p>Like the water, like the running water<br />
Me, my heart runs after your love</p>
<p>Grey, grey, love is grey<br />
My heart weeps since you went away<br />
Grey, grey, the sky is grey<br />
The rain falls when you&#8217;re not there anymore</p>
<p>The wind, the wind moans<br />
The wind weeps since you went away<br />
The wind, the cursed wind<br />
My heart weeps when you&#8217;re not there anymore</p>
<p>Like the water, like the running water<br />
Me, my heart runs after your love</p>
<p>Blue, blue, love is blue<br />
The sky is blue when you return<br />
Blue, blue, love is blue<br />
Love is blue when you take my hand</p>
<p>Mad, mad, love is mad<br />
Mad like you and mad like me<br />
Blue, blue, love is blue<br />
Love is blue when I am yours</p>
<p>Love is blue when I am yours<br />
