<p>They envy me, my hills of Clare<br />
The white gulls calling in the soft sea air<br />
So much to lose, and yet I&#8217;d leave the hills of Clare<br />
And live in a desert if I had you there<br />
What would I lose if I could choose?</p>
<p>If I could choose a place to walk with you<br />
I&#8217;d choose the longest road<br />
And it would lead us to a house that no one knew<br />
Bellows by the fire, and the turf smoke rising higher<br />
Than the lark that wings and always sings of you</p>
<p>If I could choose a time to talk with you<br />
I&#8217;d choose the longest day<br />
And over all the hills of Clare, I&#8217;d shout the news<br />
I would tell them how a day could last forever<br />
And I&#8217;d never leave your side if I could choose</p>
<p>If I could choose a time to talk with you<br />
I&#8217;d choose the longest day<br />
And over all the hills of Clare, I&#8217;d shout the news<br />
I would tell them how a day could last forever<br />
And I&#8217;d never leave your side if I could choose</p>
