Into the shadow from under the burning sun<br />
I must get into the shadow from the street of pain<br />
To safety from under the glowing sky<br />
To safety, to a green oasis</p>
<p>Above is the shining sun, underneath is the burning ground<br />
In the mind the shady resort, where I can go by myself</p>
<p>Into the shadow from under the burning sun<br />
I must soon get away, into the shadow<br />
To safety from under the glowing sky<br />
To safety under bushy leaves</p>
<p>Into the shadow from the shameless spotlights<br />
I want to get into the shadow, away from the company of the famous<br />
To safety, away from the burning love<br />
To safety of silent longing</p>
<p>My life is just restless, now I have to stand everything<br />
I already got enough fame, rest is all I miss</p>
<p>I want to get into the shadow, away from the spotlights<br />
Into the shadow, although it would be lonely there<br />
I want to go to the peaceful safety, eventually<br />
That&#8217;s when I could finally find my happiness<br />
