There was a sweet little puppet man<br />
Someone so free and bold and happy<br />
He was laughing at all the other puppets, him, oh yes</p>
<p>Because this particular puppet man<br />
Imagine, he was sharper than most<br />
He said, all of them are hanging on a string</p>
<p>He laughed at all the stupid little puppets dancing<br />
At the command of something they didn&#8217;t understand<br />
He howled with laughter, but suddenly stopped<br />
Because his string was cut in half</p>
<p>And look, our particular puppet man<br />
He understood: if the dance is to go on<br />
Then you have to jump about like all on a string</p>
<p>He laughed at all the stupid little puppets dancing<br />
At the command of something they didn&#8217;t understand<br />
He howled with laughter, but suddenly stopped<br />
Because his string was cut in half</p>
<p>Thus our particular puppet man became<br />
Lifeless and had to understand:<br />
A string has a spool and if you want to count<br />
You must jump like everyone on a string<br />
