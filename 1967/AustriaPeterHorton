Why are there a hundred thousand stars<br />
At night in the deep blue sky?<br />
Why does someone often love someone else<br />
Much more than anything else in the world?</p>
<p>Why do millions of flowers bloom<br />
And does the sun shine for the poor and rich?<br />
Is youth and dying<br />
Here on earth equal for everyone?</p>
<p>What ever is destined for you<br />
Take it as your destiny<br />
Perhaps your heart realizes<br />
This way, the real sense of life</p>
<p>Why are there a hundred thousand stars<br />
At night in the deep blue sky?<br />
Why are there always miracles?<br />
Holds a heart often truly to another heart?</p>
<p>Why does also for the poor the springtime come<br />
Often more beautiful than for the rich?<br />
Because for God in heaven<br />
Yes, everybody on earth is equal</p>
<p>Because for God in heaven<br />
Yes, everybody on earth is equal<br />
