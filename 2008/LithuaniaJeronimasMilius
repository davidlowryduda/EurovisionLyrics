<p>Through passing days, I close my eyes and feel silk burning me<br />
Your skin, those gorgeous lips I&#8217;ve kissed so long ago<br />
Tonight I&#8217;ll try to rip out this aching heart, it&#8217;s filled with you<br />
It&#8217;s filled with lonely pain &#8211; obey</p>
<p>Moon, I follow you in darkness<br />
It seems we&#8217;re nomads in the night<br />
Your cold turns me into the heartless<br />
Until the sunrise burning light<br />
Brings down her sky blue shining eyes</p>
<p>This hollow day, like days before I walk through thousand smiles<br />
And try to find the look that heals all wounds inside<br />
But still I&#8217;m here at the world&#8217;s edge falling like stone to you<br />
Shining so high, alone &#8211; like me</p>
<p>Moon, I follow you in darkness<br />
It seems we&#8217;re nomads in the night<br />
Your cold turns me into the heartless<br />
Until the sunrise burning light</p>
<p>Seems we&#8217;re nomads in the night<br />
Your cold turns me into the heartless<br />
Until the sunrise burning light<br />
Brings down her sky blue shining eyes</p>
