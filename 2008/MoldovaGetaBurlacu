<p>The rain has touched my steps, the rain has touched my smile<br />
I&#8217;m going to its depth, it takes me to the sky<br />
All the stars are falling down and now I can reach the rainbow<br />
Hold my hand and come with me to my other way of being</p>
<p>This is all I mean, be my everything<br />
And remember our dreams together<br />
This is all I need, be my everything<br />
And live forever, ever, ever</p>
<p>All I need is to find a little place to live<br />
In your heart, that&#8217;s what I want<br />
And to find the words to say, to find the words I&#8217;ve never said<br />
The words I need to touch your world and your life, to breathe your soul<br />
A century is now not enough for your love</p>
<p>This is all I need<br />
This is all I mean, be my everything<br />
And remember our dreams together<br />
This is all I mean, be my everything<br />
And live forever, ever, ever</p>
<p>All I need is to find a little place to live<br />
In your heart, that&#8217;s what I want<br />
And to find the words to say, to find the words I&#8217;ve never said<br />
The words I need to touch your world and your life, to breathe your soul<br />
A century is now not enough for my love</p>
