<p>You&#8217;re keeping me fascinated<br />
No, I ain&#8217;t running all over town<br />
I feel so intoxicated<br />
I&#8217;m struggling to keep my feet on the ground</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not playing, girl, this ain&#8217;t no game at all<br />
And for the first time I&#8217;m not looking for love<br />
So come here, baby, listen to me<br />
I just want ya to believe me</p>
<p>Even if the world stops lovin&#8217;<br />
I could never stop lovin&#8217; you<br />
Even if the sun stops risin&#8217;<br />
I still wanna wake up with you<br />
Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Even if my heart was breakin&#8217;<br />
I could never break your heart too<br />
Even if all words lost their meaning<br />
You would understand I love you<br />
Yes, I do</p>
<p>Your sensuality thrills me<br />
It strips me to my soul<br />
As your reality cures me<br />
Your lovin&#8217; takes a hold<br />
I&#8217;m barely in control</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not pretending, girl, that ain&#8217;t what&#8217;s goin&#8217; on<br />
There&#8217;s no room for lies, ain&#8217;t no room at all<br />
So come here, baby, listen to me<br />
I just want ya to believe me</p>
<p>(Even if the world stops lovin&#8217;)<br />
I could never stop lovin&#8217; you<br />
Even if the sun stops risin&#8217;<br />
I still wanna wake up with you</p>
<p>Even if my heart was breakin&#8217;<br />
I could never break your heart too, no, no<br />
Even if all words lost their meaning<br />
You would understand I love you<br />
Yes, I do</p>
<p>(Break it down, break it down)<br />
(Girl, you gotta know) Yes, I do<br />
(We got to break it down, break it down)<br />
(It&#8217;s time to feel the flow) Hey yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>(Break it down, break it down)<br />
(Girl, you gotta know) Help me break it down<br />
(We got to break it down, break it down)<br />
(It&#8217;s time to feel the flow) Ooh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>(Even if the world stops lovin&#8217;)<br />
(I could never stop lovin&#8217; you) I could never stop lovin&#8217; you<br />
(Even if the sun stops risin&#8217;)<br />
(I still wanna wake up with you) I will always wake up, baby</p>
<p>Even if my heart was breakin&#8217;<br />
(I could never break your heart too) Aha, aha, aha baby, baby<br />
Even if all words lost their meaning<br />
You would understand I love you</p>
