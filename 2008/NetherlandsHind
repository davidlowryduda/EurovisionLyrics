<p>I remember the time when I was in love with a fool<br />
He stepped on my heart, bruised me, broke the golden rule<br />
There was a time when I couldn&#8217;t tell weak from strong<br />
A voice in my head kept saying: this can&#8217;t go on<br />
Even though I longed, something&#8217;s wrong</p>
<p>You know your heart belongs to me<br />
You made it clear to see<br />
That we were never meant to be<br />
Only a memory remains</p>
<p>Oh yes, your heart belongs to me<br />
But I&#8217;ve got to set you free<br />
&#8216;Cause we were never meant to be<br />
Together</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned my lesson, now I know where I stand<br />
Time heals all wounds, and broken hearts will mend<br />
I&#8217;ve read all the signs, now I&#8217;ve moved along<br />
This carousel keeps turning on and on<br />
And on and on, life goes on</p>
<p>You know your heart belongs to me<br />
You made it clear to see<br />
That we were never meant to be<br />
Only a memory remains</p>
<p>Oh yes, your heart belongs to me<br />
But I&#8217;ve got to set you free<br />
&#8216;Cause we were never meant to be<br />
Together</p>
<p>I wish I was the wind, the sun, the rain<br />
And I could hold time in my hands<br />
In my dreams I&#8217;ll fly high so I can reach the stars</p>
<p>I sit on top of a mountain<br />
And scream when nobody hears me<br />
Nobody sees me, ho&#8230;</p>
<p>You know your heart belongs to me<br />
You made it clear to see<br />
That we were never meant to be<br />
Only a memory remains</p>
<p>Oh yes, your heart belongs to me<br />
But I&#8217;ve got to set you free<br />
&#8216;Cause we were never meant to be<br />
Together</p>
<p>You know your heart belongs to me</p>
