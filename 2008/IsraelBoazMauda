<p>My soul is longing for the warm heart&#8217;s prayer</p>
<p>It is hard, it is hard when a longing by moonlight<br />
Is here for a moment and then flees, the tears go after it<br />
It is hard, it is hard when a longing by moonlight<br />
Is here for a moment and then flees, the tears go after it</p>
<p>Sometimes the wind brings a good, familiar scent<br />
It caresses, listens to you sing now</p>
<p>Not starlight<br />
You are now<br />
With me, with me, as if real<br />
Like back then long ago</p>

You are now<br />
With me, with me, as if real<br />
