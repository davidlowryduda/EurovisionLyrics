Midnight hour is struck over the city<br />
I don&#8217;t know where you are<br />
My heart is bursting with love<br />
In an empty bed</p>
<p>Sorrow is writing songs for me<br />
While tears are falling<br />
My pillow smells like you<br />
And you&#8217;re long, long gone</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me go crazy<br />
Everything is so sad<br />
Be mine again<br />
I love you forever</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me go crazy<br />
I can&#8217;t make it on my own<br />
God and people forgive<br />
I belong to you</p>
<p>Night is ticking over the city<br />
I don&#8217;t know where you are<br />
You&#8217;re standing on the edge of my heart<br />
And I need you so much</p>
<p>I want to kiss you again<br />
To follow your steps<br />
I&#8217;m just wasting time<br />
Because you are, you are my life</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me go crazy<br />
Everything is so sad<br />
Be mine again<br />
I love you forever</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me go crazy<br />
I can&#8217;t make it on my own<br />
God and people forgive<br />
I belong to you</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t let me go crazy)<br />
(Everything is so sad)<br />
(Be mine again)<br />
I love you forever</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me go crazy<br />
I can&#8217;t make it on my own<br />
God and people forgive<br />
I belong to you<br />
I belong to you<br />
