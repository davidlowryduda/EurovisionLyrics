Huh! Hah! Huh! Hah!<br />
Huh! Hah! Huh! Hah!</p>
<p>May there be the storm and cold wind<br />
And a warm stove in the cabin<br />
It&#8217;s an honor and manhood<br />
To do one&#8217;s duty</p>
<p>Although the world is cold<br />
There may be a place for warmth as well<br />
The fields call for heroes<br />
And definitely not the cowardly</p>
<p>Where the men ride<br />
There the sheep cannot rove<br />
Where the men ride<br />
There you can hear the wolves howl</p>
<p>Huh! Hah! Huh! Hah!</p>
<p>May there be destruction ahead of you<br />
And behind us the enchantment of love<br />
Man has his duty<br />
To remember his bravery</p>
<p>Nobody can avoid pain<br />
And just float in the stream of life<br />
The fields call for heroes<br />
And definitely not the cowardly</p>
<p>Where the men ride<br />
There the sheep cannot rove<br />
Where the men ride<br />
There you can hear the wolves howl</p>
<p>Where the men, where the men ride<br />
Where the men, where the men ride</p>
<p>Where the men ride<br />
There the sheep cannot rove<br />
Where the men ride<br />
There you can hear the wolves howl</p>
<p>Where the men ride<br />
There the sheep cannot rove<br />
Where the men ride<br />
There you can hear the wolves howl</p>
<p>Where the men&#8230;Hah! Huh! Hah!<br />
Where the men&#8230;Hah! Huh! Hah!<br />
