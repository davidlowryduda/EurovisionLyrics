Come to the edge of the world<br />
Like sitting on an empty bench<br />
The sky would reach under my soles<br />
And we won&#8217;t even know if we&#8217;re dreaming</p>
<p>Today, more than ever<br />
My mind is calling you</p>
<p>A whole night long and a day<br />
With you near me, if I stay<br />
I&#8217;d think the world is mine<br />
And I&#8217;ll only give the world to you</p>
<p>Come (Come) and give me your hand<br />
I come from afar, from afar to you (To you)<br />
Oh, look (Look) at the world I dreamt of (I dreamt of)<br />
The present and the past with you</p>
<p>Today, more than ever &#8211; more than ever<br />
My mind is calling you</p>
<p>A whole night long and a day &#8211; I offer you my heart, you know<br />
With you near me, if I stay &#8211; I&#8217;m in love more than ever<br />
I&#8217;d think the world is mine &#8211; I want you so much<br />
And I&#8217;ll only give the world to you</p>
<p>My whole life with you<br />
The most beautiful dream I know &#8211; I&#8217;m in love more than ever<br />
Our path will see &#8211; I want you so much</p>
<p>The light of a timeless love<br />
The light of a timeless love<br />
Timeless</p>
<p>Tell me that you&#8217;ll only be mine<br />
