The clock ticks like a heart<br />
The clock runs crazy, it has no hands<br />
You stole the time from my life<br />
The coldness of your voice fell on my heart<br />
Covering the last shelter of love</p>
<p>Ha&#8230; ha&#8230;<br />
And the hands of time stop there</p>
<p>Day after day, we<br />
Beat after beat, we looked in vain<br />
For the perfect clock which a heart can never be</p>
<p>Night after night, we<br />
Beat after beat, we grew apart<br />
But no, we couldn&#8217;t because we both put our hearts at stake<br />
Ah&#8230;</p>
