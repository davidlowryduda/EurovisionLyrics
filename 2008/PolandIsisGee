<p>I had no choice, perfectly clear from the start<br />
I heard your voice and I was falling<br />
Into a space where daylight kisses moonlit skies<br />
It was the place as written in your eyes</p>
<p>And oh we made it, we finally found our way<br />
And celebrating just where we, we stand today</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let my heart show the way<br />
Oceans and mountains between us<br />
Because your love is why you made the wrong right<br />
I will give my all, I will heed your call for life</p>
<p>I had no choice, perfectly clear from the start<br />
I will rejoice, embrace your calling<br />
And into a space where daylight breathes within your heart<br />
You found my heart and I knew it was for life<br />
Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let my heart show the way<br />
Oceans and mountains between us<br />
Because your love is why you made the wrong right<br />
I will give my all for life<br />
Ooh yeah&#8230; for life</p>
