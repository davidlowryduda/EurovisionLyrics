<p>On and on I&#8217;ve tried to move it along (It won&#8217;t stop)<br />
Tried to find the strength to turn it around (It won&#8217;t stop)<br />
Everything&#8217;s been off since you went away<br />
And time just broke the promise to ease the pain</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I need you here and it&#8217;s just not fair<br />
That it won&#8217;t get better, why did you disappear?<br />
And we got nowhere, but it won&#8217;t stop there<br />
Though you&#8217;re gone forever, I can&#8217;t make you disappear</p>
<p>Crashing, breaking memories in my mind (It won&#8217;t stop)<br />
Never ever close to getting it right (It won&#8217;t stop)<br />
Best time of my life, now it&#8217;s washed away<br />
Still the stars, they know how to spell your name</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I need you here and it&#8217;s just not fair<br />
That it won&#8217;t get better, why did you disappear?<br />
And we got nowhere, but it won&#8217;t stop there<br />
Though you&#8217;re gone forever, I can&#8217;t make you disappear</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you got into my heart of stone<br />
And I don&#8217;t do well here on my own<br />
Now the silence keeps me up at night<br />
And I can&#8217;t get used to being all alone</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I need you here and it&#8217;s just not fair<br />
That it won&#8217;t get better, why did you disappear?<br />
And we got nowhere, but it won&#8217;t stop there<br />
Though you&#8217;re gone forever, I can&#8217;t make you disappear </p>
