<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
There&#8217;s a part of me<br />
That can&#8217;t be silenced<br />
When I see the hatred that exists<br />
The pain, the poverty</p>
<p>I see myself again as a child<br />
Running in the blue</p>
<p>It was wonderful to fly away<br />
To challenge the wind, the fantasy<br />
Your hand and mine<br />
In the same poetry, it was wonderful</p>
<p>But one night you&#8217;ll see<br />
I&#8217;ll escape from fate, I swear<br />
If life will wait for us<br />
We will return back down there</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be wonderful to fly away<br />
To still challenge the fantasy<br />
And then your hand and mine<br />
In the same poetry, it was wonderful<br />
It was wonderful</p>
<p>Because there&#8217;s no peace as long as<br />
Everyone thinks of themselves, it was wonderful<br />
It was wonderful<br />
