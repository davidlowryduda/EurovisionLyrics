Lady of the sea<br />
Before you, I&#8217;m fallen<br />
Who comes and takes half of life and peace<br />
From this table, from this house, now lost?<br />
Love, where are you?</p>
<p>Lady of the sea<br />
Before you, my soul is empty<br />
Who comes and takes what is mine?<br />
Oh high sea, bring me<br />
My endless love</p>
<p>Oh, black waters, waves of sorrow<br />
Have frozen the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)<br />
He&#8217;s not sailing any more (He&#8217;s not sailing any more)<br />
And nobody sees you crying<br />
Lady of the sea</p>
<p>Who comes and takes half of life and peace<br />
From this table, from this house, now lost?<br />
Love, where are you?</p>
<p>Oh, black waters, waves of sorrow<br />
Have frozen the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)<br />
Salty wounds, prayers in vain (Prayers in vain)<br />
Let his heart (Let his heart)<br />
Beat next to me (Beat next to me)</p>
<p>Oh, black waters, waves of sorrow<br />
Have frozen the fire in my eyes (Lady of the sea)<br />
He&#8217;s not sailing any more (He&#8217;s not sailing any more)<br />
And nobody sees you crying (And nobody sees you crying)<br />
Lady of the sea (Lady of the sea)<br />
