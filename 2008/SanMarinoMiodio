I never would have thought of you<br />
As my accomplice<br />
Capable of understanding my every joy or sorrow</p>
<p>The peace of a moment<br />
Is all that we are<br />
Is all that we feel</p>
<p>And I see you as the immensity<br />
Like a tear on a white page<br />
Between sex and music, I thought of you<br />
That you are so much more, something that isn&#8217;t there</p>
<p>And feeling you as a part of me<br />
Is like having an angel<br />
Sustain my every uncertain step</p>
<p>As always it rains<br />
When we find ourselves<br />
Suspended in the silence of a kiss</p>
<p>And I see you as the immensity<br />
Like a tear on a white page<br />
Between sex and music, I thought of you<br />
That you are so much more, something that isn&#8217;t there</p>
<p>And I see you as the immensity<br />
Like a tear on a white page<br />
Between sex and music, I thought of you<br />
That you are so much more, something that isn&#8217;t there<br />
