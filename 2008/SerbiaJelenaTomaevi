Who caresses my loved one?<br />
Who awakes those sleepy lips?<br />
Don&#8217;t forget my name<br />
When she starts kissing you</p>
<p>My dear wheat, don&#8217;t sleep<br />
Kiss him as you put me to sleep</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t break my ice, it has no water<br />
Don&#8217;t put salt on my wound, I have no more tears<br />
Whoever dances my Oro<br />
May they not dance it for the two of us<br />
Wheat, put me to sleep</p>
<p>Nuna nej, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna nej<br />
Nuna nej, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna nej<br />
Wake me on Saint Vitus&#8217; day, to look at him again</p>
<p>Nuna nej, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna nej<br />
Nuna nej, nuna nuna nuna nuna nuna nej<br />
Wake me on Saint Vitus&#8217; day, to look at him again<br />
Wake me on Saint Vitus&#8217; day, to look at him once more<br />
</div>
