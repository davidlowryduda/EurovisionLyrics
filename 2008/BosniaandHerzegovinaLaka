(Don&#8217;t come down from the balcony)<br />
(Laka the singer told me)<br />
(Don&#8217;t make noise with your sandals)<br />
(Don&#8217;t pretend to be a lady)</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t come down from the balcony)<br />
(Laka told me personally)<br />
(Don&#8217;t come down from the balcony)<br />
(Until your love is strong)</p>
<p>I tricked both fauna and flora<br />
With my favourite prank<br />
That life did not begin in the sea<br />
But of love<br />
Love, love, of love</p>
<p>How many days did we spend<br />
Lying down, eating bananas<br />
And then we fell onto the lower branches<br />
Without love<br />
Love, love, without love</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to kiss you and you can act foolish<br />
I&#8217;ll try to kiss you and you can act foolish<br />
I&#8217;ll try to wake you up and you can pretend you&#8217;re awake</p>
