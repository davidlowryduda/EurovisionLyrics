<p>(We&#8217;re gathered here today)</p>
<p>Sometimes we open a door to hope<br />
Then baby we&#8217;re hopin&#8217; the door won&#8217;t close<br />
We look all around, our future is standing there<br />
Can&#8217;t you see you&#8217;re my future?</p>
<p>We really get along<br />
Just like the sun goes with the sunshine<br />
Like a grape goes with a grapevine<br />
But you think in a blink that I&#8217;ll be bad to you</p>
<p>If you wanna have some fun, don&#8217;t run<br />
Don&#8217;t walk away when I&#8217;m your summer sun<br />
If you wanna know real love and have some fun<br />
Hmm&#8230; then baby don&#8217;t run</p>
<p>I know your history makes you shy<br />
Oh baby, it&#8217;s no mystery why you fly<br />
I&#8217;m not like the girls, the girls who just come and go<br />
And with me you won&#8217;t go solo</p>
<p>We really get along<br />
Just like the stars go with the starshine<br />
Like a ring goes with a bell chime<br />
But you say I won&#8217;t stay, you think I&#8217;ll pull away</p>
<p>If you wanna have some fun, don&#8217;t run<br />
Don&#8217;t turn away from me when I am the one<br />
I&#8217;m the one who shakes your clouds away<br />
Whenever rainy days make you insane</p>
<p>If you wanna have some fun, don&#8217;t run<br />
Don&#8217;t walk away when I&#8217;m your summer sun<br />
If you wanna know real love and have some fun<br />
Hmm&#8230; then baby don&#8217;t run</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll even walk you to the moon<br />
Walk down the beach all afternoon<br />
I just wanna be your friend for fun, fun, fun</p>
<p>If you wanna have some fun, don&#8217;t run<br />
Don&#8217;t walk away when I&#8217;m your summer sun<br />
I&#8217;m the one who shakes your clouds away<br />
Whenever rainy days make you insane</p>
<p>If you wanna have some fun, don&#8217;t run<br />
Don&#8217;t walk away when I&#8217;m your summer sun<br />
If you wanna know real love and have some fun<br />
Hmm&#8230;.then baby don&#8217;t run</p>
