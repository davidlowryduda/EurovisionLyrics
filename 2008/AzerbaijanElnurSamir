<p>For peace we pray<br />
Save us from all fears<br />
Oh Lord, save us&#8230;</p>
<p>You can feel me in your mind with every breath you take<br />
Burn the earth with flame of sins, I&#8217;ll make you feel dismay<br />
Our feelings play with us but you must keep yourself under control<br />
If you&#8217;re searching for resolves be ready for the tolls</p>
<p>Show us the right way, day after day<br />
All fears we must forget then better world we&#8217;ll get</p>
<p>If you have the greatest aim, keep it in your soul<br />
I&#8217;ll be always by your side, always in your heart<br />
Our dreams can play with us, even if we think that we keep control<br />
From all horrors of the world salvation is love, love</p>
<p>The earth is in flame and you must share the blame<br />
Look inside yourself, we both are there</p>
<p>Day after day, day after day<br />
Day&#8230;</p>
<p>Day after day<br />
All fears we must forget, then better world we&#8217;ll get<br />
Then better world we&#8217;ll get<br />
Then better world we&#8217;ll get<br />
Then better world we&#8217;ll get</p>
