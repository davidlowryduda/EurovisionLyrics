<p>Even when the thunder and storm begins<br />
I&#8217;ll be standing strong like a tree in the wind<br />
Nothing&#8217;s gonna move this mountain<br />
Or change my direction</p>
<p>I&#8217;m falling off the sky and I&#8217;m all alone<br />
The courage that&#8217;s inside&#8217;s gonna break my fall<br />
Nothing&#8217;s gonna dim my light within</p>
<p>But if I keep going on<br />
It will never be impossible<br />
Not today</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got something to believe in<br />
As long as I&#8217;m breathing<br />
There is not a limit to what I can dream</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got something to believe in<br />
Mission to keep climbing<br />
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe<br />
And I believe in me</p>
<p>Even when the world tries to pull me down<br />
Tell me that I can&#8217;t, try to turn me around<br />
I won&#8217;t let them put my fire out, without no</p>
<p>But if I keep going on<br />
It will never be impossible<br />
Not today</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve got something to believe in<br />
As long as I&#8217;m breathing<br />
There is not a limit to what I can dream</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ve got something to believe in<br />
Mission to keep climbing<br />
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe</p>
<p>And I believe I can do it all<br />
Open every door<br />
Turn unthinkable to reality<br />
You&#8217;ll see, I can do it all and more</p>
<p>Believing, as long as I&#8217;m breathing<br />
There is not a limit to what I can dream<br />
Believing, mission to keep climbing<br />
Nothing else can stop me if I just believe<br />
And I believe in me</p>
