<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
On the floor by myself, the last tear for you in my eyes<br />
I wipe the traces left by defeat<br />
You without words, in a moment destroyed my world<br />
Now I&#8217;m gathering all the shadows of love to throw them in your face</p>
<p>To hell with everything that&#8217;s between us<br />
I&#8217;m throwing your pictures on the floor<br />
To hell with it, I&#8217;m moving forward on my own<br />
Tearing apart all the memories so it&#8217;ll be over soon</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not letting you look me in the eyes ever again<br />
Now there&#8217;s nothing in me for you<br />
You&#8217;re a stranger to me, whom I don&#8217;t recognize in the street<br />
When I see you I pass by you, turning my head the other way</p>
<p>To hell with everything that&#8217;s between us<br />
I&#8217;m throwing your pictures on the floor<br />
To hell with it, I&#8217;m moving forward on my own<br />
Tearing apart all the memories so it&#8217;ll be over soon</p>
<p>To hell with everything that&#8217;s between us<br />
I know that tears for you are a waste<br />
Now there&#8217;s only drama between us<br />
Which won&#8217;t return my stolen dreams<br />
(My stolen dreams) Dreams</p>
<p>You broke me, I admit<br />
But I&#8217;m moving on<br />
By myself into every new day<br />
I&#8217;m stronger than ever before</p>
<p>To hell with everything that&#8217;s between us<br />
I&#8217;m throwing your pictures on the floor<br />
To hell with it, I&#8217;m moving forward on my own<br />
Tearing apart all the memories so it&#8217;ll be over soon</p>
<p>To hell with everything that&#8217;s between us<br />
I know that tears for you are a waste<br />
Now there&#8217;s only drama between us<br />
Which won&#8217;t return my stolen dreams<br />
