You see my friend, I remember everything<br />
And I can tell you that between this<br />
And a million other songs, there is no difference</p>
<p>For this life erases traces behind us<br />
In the good night strange devils are released<br />
So every dream is lit up by the cold sun<br />
And the memories are almost all extinguished</p>
<p>If you ask me, just one more thing I would know<br />
That all colours only exist with this rhyme<br />
While the night and day are the trace of some verse<br />
And they will disappear when all our songs vanish</p>
<p>Play that romance tonight<br />
Quietly, tenderly, so it makes me ill<br />
Sorrow when the nightingale is dying<br />
When the soul separates from the body</p>
<p>Play that romance tonight<br />
But slowly so that everyone hears it</p>
<p>Let the guitars play again<br />
I haven&#8217;t heard them for so long</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told today that I&#8217;m out of my league<br />
Technological waste like a monkey on a branch<br />
And I was the first Internet in the world<br />
On the ships I connected the planet with music</p>
<p>Even now I remember all the dreams of my songs<br />
All the fantasies and the faces that are gone<br />
Like shadows they are a part of my awakenings<br />
Captured in me, interwoven a long time ago</p>
<p>Play that romance tonight<br />
Quietly, tenderly, so it makes me ill<br />
Sorrow when the nightingale is dying<br />
When the soul separates from the body</p>
<p>Play that romance tonight<br />
But slowly so that everyone hears it<br />
Let the guitars play again<br />
I haven&#8217;t heard them for so long</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told today that I&#8217;m out of my league<br />
Technological waste like a monkey on a branch<br />
And I was the first Internet in the world<br />
On the ships I connected the planet with music</p>
<p>I connected, I connected<br />
I, I, I was the first Internet in the world<br />
I connected the planet<br />
