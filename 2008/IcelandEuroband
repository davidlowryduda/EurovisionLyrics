<p>I spent my days in vain just waiting<br />
For happiness to come my way<br />
I took for granted all they gave me<br />
I opened my eyes, finally I realised</p>
<p>This is my life, I don&#8217;t wanna change a thing<br />
This is my life, all the pain, all the joy it brings<br />
All through the years of blood, sweat and tears<br />
Hopes and my fears, all that was meant to be<br />
This is my life, what will be, will be</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying all the heartaches, mmm&#8230;<br />
Were just a blessing in disguise, oh<br />
If I never made a single mistake<br />
Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t be here, part of the plan I believe</p>
<p>This is my life, I don&#8217;t wanna change a thing<br />
This is my life, all the pain, all the joy it brings<br />
All through the years of blood, sweat and tears<br />
Hopes and my fears, all that was meant to be<br />
This is my life, what will be, will be</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found the key to set myself free<br />
You&#8217;ll be amazed, &#8217;cause I have the power to change my ways<br />
This is my life</p>
<p>This is my life, I don&#8217;t wanna change a thing<br />
This is my life, all the pain, all the joy it brings<br />
All through the years of blood, sweat and tears<br />
Hopes and my fears, all that was meant to be<br />
This is my life, what will be</p>
<p>This is my life</p>
