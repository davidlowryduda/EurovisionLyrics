<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Weeks go by, summer scents expire<br />
Autumn leaves, memories, an untold desire<br />
It burns in me, waiting patiently<br />
Never sleeps or tires, but grows by the hour</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Come and wake me from this lonely place<br />
All I want is you<br />
If you take me to the stars and back<br />
I will know my dream is true</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart<br />
Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet<br />
Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine<br />
All my fears subside when I look into your eyes</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>So step inside and place your hand into mine<br />
What you are is a blessing to my life</em></font><br />
Well my lord, please be with me now, send him to me<br />
I don&#8217;t care for how long, but it&#8217;s so good waiting for him</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I will fly tonight, forever keep you in my heart<br />
Make it feel so right when you love me by sweet<br />
Candlelight, hold me till the morning shine<br />
All my fears subside when I look into your eyes</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>When I look into your eyes, in your eyes<br />
When I look into your eyes</em></font><br />
