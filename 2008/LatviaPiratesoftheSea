<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re hoisting the flag to be free<br />
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go<br />
We are wolves of the sea</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to run, it&#8217;s all set and done<br />
There&#8217;s a treasure in sight<br />
We are robbing you blind<br />
I hope you don&#8217;t mind<br />
We are taking it all tonight</p>
<p>Just walk away, we will conquer it all<br />
Pirates will stand and the loser will fall</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re bound to be close to the sea<br />
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:<br />
Pirates are all we can be</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re hoisting the flag to be free<br />
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go<br />
We are wolves of the sea</p>
<p>Down to the core, we&#8217;re coming for more<br />
With a sword close at hand<br />
We are scary and bold, a chest full of gold<br />
We get sealegs when sighting land</p>
<p>The hook of our captain is looking at you<br />
There&#8217;s no Peter Pan, so what can you do?</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re bound to be close to the sea<br />
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:<br />
Pirates are all we can be</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re hoisting the flag to be free<br />
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go<br />
We are wolves of the sea</p>
<p>If you cry out to storm<br />
We pirates will stand tall<br />
A skull and crossbone flag is closing in<br />
To see you fall</p>
<p>(Hum, hi ho, hi hum, hi hey)<br />
(Hum, hi ho, hi hey)<br />
(Hum, hi ho, hi hum, hi hey)</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re hoisting the flag to be free<br />
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go<br />
We are wolves of the sea</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re bound to be close to the sea<br />
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing:<br />
Pirates are all we can be</p>
<p>With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey<br />
We&#8217;re hoisting the flag to be free<br />
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go<br />
We are wolves of the sea<br />
We are wolves of the sea</p>
