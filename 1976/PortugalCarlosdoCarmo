I could call you my homeland<br />
Give you the most beautiful pretty Portuguese name<br />
I could give you the name of a queen<br />
Because this love is like that of Peter and Ines</p>
<p>But there is no form, there is no verse<br />
There is no bed for this fire, my love, for this river<br />
How can I say my heart jumped out of my chest?<br />
My love overflowed and I&#8217;m without ship</p>
<p>Loving you is like a poem that I don&#8217;t dare to say<br />
There is no cup, my love, for this wine<br />
There is no guitar or love song<br />
There is no flower, there is no green-pine flower</p>
<p>There is no boat or wheat, there is no clover<br />
No words to write this song<br />
Loving you is a poem that I don&#8217;t dare to write<br />
There is a river without a bed and I&#8217;m without heart</p>
<p>There is no form, there is no verse<br />
There is no bed for this fire, my love, for this river<br />
How can I say my heart jumped out of my chest?<br />
My love overflowed and I&#8217;m without ship</p>
<p>Loving you is like a poem that I don&#8217;t dare to say<br />
There is no cup, my love, for this wine<br />
There is no guitar or love song<br />
There is no flower, there is no green-pine flower<br />
