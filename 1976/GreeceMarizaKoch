Fields full of oranges, oh-oh my Mother<br />
Where olive trees spread from end to end<br />
Around them, the seashores shine like gold, oh-oh my Mother<br />
And you&#8217;re blinded, blinded by the intense light</p>
<p>When you go to this place, oh-oh my Mother<br />
And you see, you see tents in a row<br />
It&#8217;s not a camping place for tourists, oh-oh my Mother<br />
They&#8217;re only, only refugees</p>
<p>My Lady, my Lady<br />
Soothe my heart<br />
My Lady, my Lady<br />
Soothe my heart</p>
<p>And if you see shattered ruins, oh-oh my Mother<br />
It&#8217;s not from other, from other eras<br />
It is burnt by napalm, oh-oh my Mother<br />
Since yesterday, there are countless crumbled rocks</p>
<p>And if you see newly dug land, oh-oh my Mother<br />
They&#8217;re not fertile fields, fields<br />
There will be crosses planted on them, oh-oh my Mother<br />
Which will decompose, decompose through time</p>
<p>My Lady, my Lady<br />
Soothe my heart<br />
My Lady, my Lady<br />
Soothe my heart<br />
