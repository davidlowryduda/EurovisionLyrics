Sometimes, even words are unnecessary<br />
When we&#8217;re simply talking about love<br />
And I prefer the eloquence of a silence<br />
To a used phrase which means nothing in my heart</p>
<p>I know that you can think<br />
That I don&#8217;t have interest<br />
But sometimes the most fervent promises<br />
Only try to hide that love is dying</p>
<p>Love, love, my love<br />
You should accept me that way<br />
If you see that I don&#8217;t like to talk<br />
Learn to interpret my absence</p>
<p>Love, love, my love<br />
That&#8217;s all I can say<br />
Loving is different from laughing<br />
I know that I&#8217;ll fill your life with love</p>
<p>Sometimes, even words are unnecessary<br />
When we&#8217;re simply talking about love<br />
And the sign that even escapes attention<br />
Can be more important than an oath to God</p>
<p>Love, love, my love<br />
You should accept me that way<br />
If you see that I don&#8217;t like to talk<br />
Learn to interpret my absence</p>
<p>Love, love, my love<br />
You should accept me that way<br />
That&#8217;s all I can say, love, love<br />
