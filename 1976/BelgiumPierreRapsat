Judy, Judy isn&#8217;t beautiful<br />
Judy, Judy, the one who is forgotten (She is forgotten)<br />
From the moment the evening ends</p>
<p>Judy, Judy, you are needled<br />
Judy, Judy, you are married (You are married)<br />
But always with a dream</p>
<p>Underneath your mascara and jewels<br />
You pray to Saint Marylin Monroe<br />
To be a doll, a darling toy<br />
Burning with enthusiasm, finally the woman</p>
<p>Judy, Judy escapes<br />
Judy, Judy, in magic (In magic)<br />
Bottles that are so soft to believe</p>
<p>Judy, life is a ridiculous dream<br />
A day, an evening changing of skin<br />
With the girls on photo<br />
To have a body, thin as reed<br />
And eyes totally empty, but no wrinkles</p>
<p>Judy, Judy and company<br />
Judy, Judy, she is sacrificed (She is sacrificed)<br />
Against a handful of snow<br />
Poor Judy<br />
