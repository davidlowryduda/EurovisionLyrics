And Paris looks sad under the rain<br />
And Paris looks sad in your eyes<br />
In your room up there, you are bored<br />
You fall asleep like an unhappy clown</p>
<p>Let go of these wet streets<br />
And of these people who are always hasty<br />
Let go of your despair<br />
And follow me</p>
<p>If you want, we&#8217;ll live &#8211; you, the music and I<br />
Yes, simply you, the music and I<br />
In another universe above the clouds</p>
<p>If you want, we&#8217;ll live &#8211; you, the music and I<br />
Yes, simply you, the music and I<br />
In a new world, almost unreal</p>
<p>Imagine a town in the sun<br />
Imagine the return of a lover<br />
The smile of a child who&#8217;s waking up<br />
A page of life at daybreak</p>
<p>My love, take my hand<br />
From tomorrow on, we&#8217;ll be one<br />
Don&#8217;t be afraid anymore, don&#8217;t hesitate<br />
And follow me</p>
<p>If you want, we&#8217;ll live &#8211; you, the music and I<br />
Yes, simply you, the music and I<br />
In another universe above the clouds</p>
<p>If you want, we&#8217;ll live &#8211; you, the music and I<br />
Yes, simply you, the music and I<br />
In a new world, almost unreal</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll live &#8211; you, the music and I<br />
Yes, simply you, the music and I<br />
In another universe above the clouds</p>
<p>If you want, we&#8217;ll live &#8211; you, the music and I<br />
Yes, simply you, the music and I<br />
In a new world, almost unreal</p>
<p>The music and I<br />
The music and I<br />
