<p>When the days of wine are gone<br />
And all the nights are long<br />
Then all my thoughts run on to you</p>
<p>When the lonely silence calls<br />
When I walk through empty halls<br />
Then all my thoughts run on to you</p>
<p>And when they linger for a while<br />
You come and touch me with your tender smile</p>
<p>And when your love was all my world<br />
My days, my life â€“ you were<br />
Then all the songs were songs of you</p>
<p>I tasted well of sweet success<br />
Nothing touched me that was second best</p>
<p>Oh, but then I turned and you were gone<br />
To someone else&#8217;s song<br />
And now I&#8217;m going back to when<br />
I loved you now and then</p>
<p>When the story now is told<br />
And all my love unfolds<br />
I&#8217;ve lost my very soul to you</p>
<p>Your love was written in the sky<br />
But at the time, I never looked so high</p>
<p>Darlin&#8217;, when will you come back to me?<br />
Release me, set me free<br />
When? Oh&#8230; when?</p>
