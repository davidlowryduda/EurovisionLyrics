So many melodies mark our life<br />
And without them, the world would be poorer today</p>
<p>Presents or pasts, they make us dream<br />
And everyone among us will keep hidden in their heart</p>
<p>Songs for those who love each other<br />
Old songs with eternal words<br />
Songs that are remembered and come back after love</p>
<p>Songs for those who love each other<br />
New songs with words of lovers<br />
Always loyal songs that recall us the happy days</p>
<p>We can redo everything, change the world<br />
To live without frontiers, we&#8217;ll sing<br />
To forget history, to believe, not to believe anymore<br />
In our memories, it will stay</p>
<p>Songs for those who love each other<br />
That are remembered and that people were waiting for<br />
One day, sing the same and may it become<br />
The hymn of peace from now on, from now on<br />
