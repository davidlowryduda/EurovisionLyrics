<p>There are days I just can&#8217;t make it even though I try to fake it<br />
When I wish that I could take it, turn a page and start anew<br />
In a world with no tomorrow, I could throw away my sorrow<br />
And pretend you&#8217;d let me borrow all the magic and wonder of you<br />
And for a while feel alive</p>
<p>Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender<br />
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender<br />
Those you conquered with your dance never did have a chance<br />
You walked away laughing and left them alone with their shame</p>
<p>As our dreams are slowly dyin&#8217;, we find no escape in lyin&#8217;<br />
Why should we go on denyin&#8217; life is never what it seems?<br />
But in times when I am lonely, I keep thinkin&#8217; of you only<br />
Even though you&#8217;d never known me, can&#8217;t you visit me once in my life<br />
And let me feel you were real?</p>
<p>Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender<br />
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender<br />
Those you conquered with your dance – they never did have a chance<br />
You walked away laughing and left them alone with their shame</p>
<p>Mata Hari, any man would pay the price of sweet surrender<br />
Mata Hari, for the promise in your eyes – it was so tender<br />
All the secrets sealed with their lips, they gave away for a kiss<br />
The eye of the morning and star of the night was your name</p>
