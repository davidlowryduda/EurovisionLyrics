<p>I used to love watching beautiful girls go by in my time<br />
You have done like the boys do, but now finally you are mine<br />
Let bygones be bygones, now I love you<br />
You gave me more than a man can ever dream, know what I mean?</p>
<p>Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
That&#8217;s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay&#8230;<br />
Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
Give me shivers all down my spine&#8230; ay ay ay&#8230;</p>
<p>You are not a moment&#8217;s playmate<br />
You are the man of my life<br />
Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
That&#8217;s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay&#8230;</p>
<p>I used to worry so much about all kinds of little things<br />
Now it is easy to laugh and to dance when it really swings<br />
Now we&#8217;re together forever, I know<br />
Playing the games that two people only play when they&#8217;re in love</p>
<p>Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
That&#8217;s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay&#8230;<br />
Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
Give me shivers all down my spine&#8230; ay ay ay&#8230;</p>
<p>You are not a moment&#8217;s playmate<br />
You are the man of my life<br />
Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
That&#8217;s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay&#8230;</p>
<p>Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
That&#8217;s the way we dance till we die.. ay ay ay&#8230;<br />
Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
Give me shivers all down my spine&#8230; ay ay ay&#8230;</p>
<p>Let your hip go hippety pump pump<br />
That&#8217;s the way we dance till we die</p>
