<p>The lights are low, the party&#8217;s goin&#8217; on<br />
And he who&#8217;s mine, he doesn&#8217;t seem to miss me<br />
I feel alone, I think that I&#8217;ll go home<br />
But if I stay, at least I hear him</p>
<p>The party&#8217;s over now, the party&#8217;s over now<br />
At least I dream it&#8217;s over now<br />
He&#8217;s sittin&#8217; next to me and we do both agree<br />
Our life ain&#8217;t bad at all</p>
<p>Yes, the party&#8217;s over now<br />
One of those bad dreams<br />
Suddenly came over me<br />
But now I feel at ease</p>
<p>The lights go out, the party&#8217;s goin&#8217; on<br />
And he who&#8217;s mine seems really to enjoy it<br />
I hear him whisper sweet words, but not to me<br />
I wonder, am I really dreamin&#8217;?</p>
<p>The party&#8217;s over now, the party&#8217;s over now<br />
At least I dream it&#8217;s over now<br />
He&#8217;s sittin&#8217; next to me and we do both agree<br />
Our life ain&#8217;t bad at all</p>
<p>Yes, the party&#8217;s over now<br />
One of those bad dreams<br />
Suddenly came over me<br />
But now I feel at ease</p>
<p>Yes, the party&#8217;s over now<br />
One of those bad dreams<br />
Suddenly came over me<br />
But now I feel at ease</p>
