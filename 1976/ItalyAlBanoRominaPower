<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I remember your face, when the first time we kissed<br />
How you started to blush, what you said when you touched my hand<br />
And the drives to the beach with the sand on my feet<br />
What we drew on the shore &#8211; it&#8217;s as if it were yesterday</em></font></p>
<p>I remember those days, love until dawn<br />
Your antique dolls smiled together with you<br />
And your short dresses, like flourishing meadows<br />
That, waving in the wind, gave me back my freedom</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;d live it all again</em></font>, I&#8217;d live it again as well<br />
I&#8217;d live it again as well, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>we&#8217;ll live it all again</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>When we had our first babe, how we found her new games<br />
How she smiled when she saw me, and the first time she called you dad<br />
All the good times we had, although some &#8211; they were bad<br />
Through the laughter and pain, but the feeling was always there</em></font></p>
<p>I remember those years, just how many songs<br />
How many masks around, and only you near me<br />
Loneliness in two and one hundred years are few<br />
If I lived again, I&#8217;d always choose you again</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;d live it all again</em></font>, I&#8217;d live it again as well<br />
I&#8217;d live it again as well, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>we&#8217;ll live it all again</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I remember your face, when the first time we kissed<br />
How you started to blush, what you said when you touched my hand</em></font><br />
And your short dresses, like flourishing meadows<br />
That, waving in the wind, gave me back my freedom<br />
