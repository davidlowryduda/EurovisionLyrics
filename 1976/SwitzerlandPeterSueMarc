<p>The birds have known the old man for many years<br />
His eyes have seen so much and look so mild<br />
He&#8217;s up at four and early every morning<br />
He feeds them and feels happy like a child</p>
<p>Once he was a clown in the arena<br />
People said the best that ever was<br />
Now they call him good old Djambo Djambo<br />
But in his dreams, he still hears the applause</p>
<p>Hey hey hey&#8230; hey hey hey&#8230; Djambo Djambo<br />
Don&#8217;t be sad, for you know that the show must go on<br />
Hey hey hey&#8230; hey hey hey&#8230; Djambo Djambo<br />
It was you who had us laughing, you&#8217;re the one</p>
<p>And sometimes you can see him on the sidewalk<br />
With little boys and girls around his feets<br />
When Djambo Djambo plays his barrel organ<br />
Children call it circus in the streets</p>
<p>Suddenly his eyes reflect emotion<br />
In Djambo&#8217;s mind, the limelight shines again<br />
He&#8217;s back on stage and all the kids are laughing<br />
Just as if the show would never end</p>
<p>Hey hey hey&#8230; hey hey hey&#8230; Djambo Djambo<br />
Don&#8217;t be sad, for you know that the show must go on<br />
Hey hey hey&#8230; hey hey hey&#8230; Djambo Djambo<br />
It was you who had us laughing, you&#8217;re the one</p>
<p>Hey hey hey&#8230; hey hey hey&#8230; Djambo Djambo<br />
Don&#8217;t be sad, for you know that the show must go on<br />
Hey hey hey&#8230; hey hey hey&#8230; Djambo Djambo<br />
It was you who had us laughing, you&#8217;re the one<br />
It was you who had us laughing, you&#8217;re the one</p>
