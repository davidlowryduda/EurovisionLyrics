<p>Though it hurts to go away, it&#8217;s impossible to stay<br />
But there&#8217;s one thing I must say before I go:<br />
I love you (I love you), you know<br />
I&#8217;ll be thinkin&#8217; of you in most everything I do</p>
<p>Now the time is movin&#8217; on and I really should be gone<br />
But you keep me hangin&#8217; on for one more smile<br />
I love you (I love you) all the while<br />
With your cute little wave<br />
Will you promise that you&#8217;ll save your&#8230;</p>
<p>Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me<br />
Bye bye, baby, bye bye<br />
Don&#8217;t cry, honey, don&#8217;t cry<br />
Gonna walk out the door<br />
But I&#8217;ll soon be back for more</p>
<p>Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me<br />
So long, honey, so long<br />
Hang on, baby, hang on<br />
Don&#8217;t you dare me to stay<br />
&#8216;Cause you know I&#8217;ll have to say</p>
<p>That I&#8217;ve got to work each day and that&#8217;s why I go away<br />
But I count the seconds till I&#8217;m home with you<br />
I love you (I love you), it&#8217;s true<br />
You&#8217;re so cute honey, gee<br />
Won&#8217;t you save them up for me? Your&#8230;</p>
<p>Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me<br />
Bye bye, baby, bye bye<br />
Don&#8217;t cry, honey, don&#8217;t cry<br />
Gonna walk out the door<br />
But I&#8217;ll soon be back for more</p>
<p>Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me<br />
So long, honey, so long<br />
Hang on, baby, hang on<br />
Don&#8217;t you dare me to stay<br />
&#8216;Cause you know you&#8217;ve got to save your&#8230;</p>
<p>Kisses for me, save all your kisses for me<br />
Bye bye, baby, bye bye<br />
Don&#8217;t cry, honey, don&#8217;t cry<br />
Won&#8217;t you save them for me<br />
Even though you&#8217;re only three?</p>
