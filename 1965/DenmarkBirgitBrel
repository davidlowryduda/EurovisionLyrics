<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
For your sake I wear rustling skirts<br />
For your sake I&#8217;m girlish, sensitive and coy<br />
For your sake I have to be conquered every time<br />
For your dream is to tame me, weak and shy<br />
While I bravely resist</p>
<p>Every time, must be like then<br />
Every time I give, you&#8217;d rather take</p>
<p>But my dream is to love in friendship<br />
I&#8217;m tired of my femininity<br />
For it makes you so broad-shouldered<br />
I don&#8217;t care for men, who are men<br />
But for men, who are human</p>
<p>For your sake the comedy&#8217;s over<br />
For your sake it&#8217;s time to take off the masks<br />
For your sake your lover revolts<br />
I&#8217;m not your prey, but peer<br />
Human, I say it for your sake</p>
<p>For otherwise I&#8217;ll slide away<br />
