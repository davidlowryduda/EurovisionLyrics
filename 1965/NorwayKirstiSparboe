Mummy, I&#8217;m meeting our Kjell and our Arne now tonight<br />
We&#8217;ll go Dutch for a ride on a fun merry-go-round</p>
<p>Mummy, who should I go with first?<br />
Maybe Arne as he&#8217;s the biggest?<br />
Yes, he&#8217;ll beat up Kjell if he pulls my ponytail<br />
Or calls me his pop-girl</p>
<p>But when Arne and I go for a ride<br />
Kjell becomes so incredibly cross<br />
So I think it&#8217;s best we go all three<br />
In a wagon large enough</p>
<p>Mummy, I&#8217;m in love with Kjell<br />
Of course I&#8217;ll go with him all the same<br />
As we race along I&#8217;ll give him a big hug<br />
And then he can take me home</p>
<p>Poor Arne must stand there and watch<br />
But I can&#8217;t let that bother me<br />
I surely have enough with myself<br />
While I&#8217;m racing along with our Kjell</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m racing along, while I&#8217;m racing along<br />
While I&#8217;m racing on our merry-go-round<br />
