<p>A night of spring is a lovely thing<br />
But I feel sad in this night of spring<br />
For this is the time the sloe gets bright<br />
And this is a most bewitching night</p>
<p>And I am lonely and you are far<br />
And you can&#8217;t hear what I sing</p>
<p>I wish I knew where you are tonight<br />
I wish you&#8217;re thinking of me tonight<br />
Where are you tonight?</p>
<p>I wish you feel how I long for you<br />
And I wish you&#8217;re missing me too<br />
And I wish I knew where to go<br />
Knowing you, knowing you</p>
<p>We ought to walk where the cowslips grow<br />
Behind the hedge of candescent sloe<br />
And you ought to smile and look at me<br />
And I ought to kiss you tenderly</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t know if you still are mine<br />
This lovely evening of spring</p>
<p>I wish I knew where you are tonight<br />
I wish you&#8217;re thinking of me tonight<br />
Where are you tonight?</p>
<p>I wish you feel how I long for you<br />
And I wish you&#8217;re missing me too<br />
And I wish I knew where to go<br />
Knowing you, knowing you<br />
Tonight</p>
