It&#8217;s enough<br />
I have enough of all the games with fire<br />
I have enough of all the beautiful compliments<br />
And presents, it&#8217;s enough<br />
I want to be happy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough</p>
<p>What you promised me seemed so romantic<br />
But soon that fairy tale appeared to be a deceptive appearance<br />
And when you threw our love away that evening in May<br />
That was enough</p>
<p>Maybe you loved me, I was so happy with you<br />
That I gladly wanted to share my life with you<br />
But that you&#8217;re always lying and cheating me consciously<br />
Is unacceptable to a woman<br />
Who, always faithful would tell you then:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough<br />
I have enough of all the games with fire<br />
I have enough of all the beautiful compliments<br />
And presents, it&#8217;s enough<br />
I want to be happy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known many men and also illusions<br />
I don&#8217;t believe in romances anymore, for a long time now<br />
In the long term every adventure finds<br />
Its ending in grief anyhow<br />
That&#8217;s enough</p>
<p>Yet I&#8217;m still dreaming of a quite common man<br />
One who can love me sincerely and unrestrained<br />
I&#8217;m tired of flirting, ready for true love<br />
Because I&#8217;m still a young woman<br />
Who, always faithfully would tell him then:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough<br />
I have enough of all the games with fire<br />
Even though you don&#8217;t give me any nice compliments<br />
The moments of luck<br />
You give them enough</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough, it&#8217;s enough<br />
It&#8217;s enough<br />
