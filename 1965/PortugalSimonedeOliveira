God knows that I wanted to be happy with you<br />
To live in the sunlight of your most tender look<br />
Now your desire is dead, I live my own desire<br />
Blooming spring in the winter sun</p>
<p>Dreams that I dreamt, where are they?<br />
Hours that I lived, who has them?<br />
What&#8217;s the use of having a heart, and not having anyone&#8217;s love?</p>
<p>Kisses that I gave you, where are they?<br />
Who have you given what belonged to me?<br />
It&#8217;s better not to have a heart, than having it and not having it, like me</p>
<p>I bartered everything in my life for nothing<br />
Defeated flag, torn in the ground<br />
I&#8217;m the forgotten date, the lost thing that goes on auction</p>
<p>Dreams that I dreamt, where are they?<br />
Hours that I lived, who has them?<br />
What&#8217;s the use of having a heart, and not having anyone&#8217;s love?<br />
I live of longings, my love, my life has lost the splendour<br />
Like a winter sun I have no warmth</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the use of having a heart, and not having anyone&#8217;s love?<br />
I live of longings, my love, my life has lost the splendour<br />
Like a winter sun I have no warmth<br />
