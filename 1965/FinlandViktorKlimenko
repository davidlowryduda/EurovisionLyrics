In the morning the sun rose, brightening up my sky<br />
The fulfilment of dreams rowed in the purple clouds&#8230;</p>
<p>Now the sun sets in the west<br />
The evening has already arrived<br />
The sun sets in the west<br />
The loveless sun</p>
<p>I never thought that the evening<br />
Would arrive so soon<br />
Until I saw a blue bird<br />
Heading south</p>
<p>I saw it and I understood it:<br />
The time of love is gone<br />
When the sun sets in the west</p>
<p>I thought the sun of my happiness<br />
Had halted in the sky<br />
Until I saw a fading sparkle<br />
In the foam of fiery water</p>
<p>I saw it and I understood it:<br />
The time of love is gone<br />
When the sun sets in the west<br />
When the sun sets in the west<br />
