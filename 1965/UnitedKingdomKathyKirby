<p>I belong, I belong, I belong</p>
<p>Since half my life, my heart&#8217;s been sleepin&#8217;<br />
For all this time, my love&#8217;s been keepin&#8217;</p>
<p>But now my heart has recovered<br />
From past affairs that turned wrong<br />
All my dreams are uncovered<br />
I belong, I belong, I belong</p>
<p>At first, I thought &#8211; just one more lover<br />
But then I found why he&#8217;s like no other</p>
<p>And now my heart has recovered<br />
From past affairs that turned wrong<br />
All my dreams are uncovered<br />
I belong, I belong, I belong</p>
<p>Too many hours slipped away<br />
Too many loves came my way<br />
But they only broke my heart in two<br />
While it needed someone just like you</p>
<p>At last you came, and from now on<br />
The two of us would be as one</p>
<p>Yes, now my heart has recovered<br />
From past affairs that turned wrong<br />
All my dreams are uncovered<br />
I belong, I belong, I belong</p>
<p>I belong</p>
