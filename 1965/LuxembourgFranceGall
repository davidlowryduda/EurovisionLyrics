I&#8217;m a wax doll, a sawdust doll<br />
My heart is engraved in my songs<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll</p>
<p>Am I better, am I worse than a fashion doll?<br />
I see life through bright rosy-tinted glasses<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll</p>
<p>My records are a mirror<br />
In which everyone can see me<br />
I&#8217;m everywhere at once<br />
Broken in a thousand pieces of voice</p>
<p>Around me, I hear the rag dolls laughing<br />
Those who dance to my songs<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll</p>
<p>They give in to a yes, to a name<br />
Love is not only in songs<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll</p>
<p>My records are mirrors<br />
In which everyone can see me<br />
I&#8217;m everywhere at once<br />
Broken in thousand pieces of voice</p>
<p>Alone, sometimes I sigh, I say to myself: &#8220;What good&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Singing about love this way for no reason&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Without knowing anything of boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m nothing but a wax doll, but a sawdust doll<br />
Under the sun of my blond hair<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll</p>
<p>But one day I&#8217;ll live my songs<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll<br />
Without fearing the warmth of boys<br />
Wax doll, sawdust doll<br />
