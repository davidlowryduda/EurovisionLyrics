Go and tell love<br />
That I&#8217;m seventeen years old<br />
Tell him that while dreaming<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for him, I&#8217;m waiting for him, I&#8217;m waiting for him</p>
<p>Go and tell love<br />
That he must come as a friend<br />
And we&#8217;ll see<br />
If my heart, if my heart keeps him</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll know better than me<br />
Where to find him in the night<br />
You&#8217;ll know better than me<br />
How to talk to him as a friend</p>
<p>Go and tell love<br />
That before his awakening<br />
My days are just like<br />
Days and days without sun</p>
<p>But why, but for whom<br />
Are the flowers of spring?<br />
But why and for whom<br />
Does my heart beat more often?</p>
<p>Go and tell love<br />
That I&#8217;m seventeen years old<br />
Tell him that while dreaming<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for him, I&#8217;m waiting for him, I&#8217;m waiting for him<br />
And that he must think of me for a long time<br />
