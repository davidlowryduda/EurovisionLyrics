Never admit, never, never, never, never<br />
Never admit that you love<br />
Never admit, never, never, oh no, never<br />
Never admit that you love her</p>
<p>If you want to be given everything you&#8217;re waiting for<br />
If you want the autumn to have the scent of springtime<br />
Be the one who changes course and always remember<br />
That you have to sow doubt to reap love</p>
<p>Never admit, never, never, never, never<br />
Never admit that you love<br />
Never admit, never, never, oh no, never<br />
Never admit that you love her</p>
<p>If you keep defending your happiness in love<br />
If you keep listening to the most tender confessions<br />
Be the one who is loved for saying nothing<br />
Who begins a poem but doesn&#8217;t finish it</p>
<p>Never admit, never, never, never, never<br />
Never admit that you love<br />
Never admit, never, never, oh no, never<br />
Never admit that you love her</p>
<p>Never admit, never, never, never, never<br />
Never admit that you love her<br />
