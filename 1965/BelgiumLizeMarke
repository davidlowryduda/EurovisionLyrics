I&#8217;ll save the drops of dew when it&#8217;s springtime again<br />
I&#8217;ll buy for you just what you want when it&#8217;s your holiday<br />
I&#8217;ll be waiting for you for ever<br />
And in my thoughts I am with you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m counting the stars of April in the sky<br />
I wanted to spend my life with you happily<br />
I&#8217;ll save the pearls of dew for you<br />
When it&#8217;s springtime again, for you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go and close the doors every evening<br />
I&#8217;ll turn off the lights every evening<br />
In summer, we&#8217;ll go and have a picnic outside<br />
And for each bite, you&#8217;ll get a kiss</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll save the drops of dew when it&#8217;s springtime again<br />
I&#8217;ll buy for you just what you want when it&#8217;s your holiday<br />
I&#8217;ll be waiting for you for ever<br />
And in my thoughts I am with you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m counting the stars of April in the sky<br />
I wanted to spend my life with you happily<br />
I&#8217;ll save the pearls of dew for you<br />
When it&#8217;s springtime again, for you<br />
