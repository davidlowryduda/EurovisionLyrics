Tell her, that I send her my love<br />
Tell her, that I&#8217;m feeling fine<br />
Don&#8217;t tell her about my tears<br />
And how my heart still hurts</p>
<p>Tell her, that I send her my love<br />
Tell her, that I&#8217;m happy<br />
Don&#8217;t tell her about my hope<br />
That often lies to my heart</p>
<p>Say hello to her, when you see her<br />
And when she begins to speak about me<br />
Then tell her what you want<br />
Only the truth you can&#8217;t tell her, please don&#8217;t, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Tell her, that I send her my love<br />
Tell her, that I&#8217;m feeling fine<br />
She went away, away from me<br />
And she knows, that nothing remains with me<br />
In spite of that, tell her that I love her</p>
<p>She went away, away from me<br />
And she knows that nothing remains with me<br />
In spite of that, tell her that I love her</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; I love her<br />
