Sleep, my love<br />
The sun is still far from the day<br />
We have all the time to love<br />
And the night understands us</p>
<p>Sleep, my love<br />
Protected by my arms that surround<br />
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness<br />
Sleep onto my heart</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a king that holds his whole kingdom in his fingers<br />
And that shivers of seeing this enchanted kingdom falling down</p>
<p>Sleep, my love<br />
My princess, locked up in her tower<br />
With all the refrains of the night<br />
My sleepy princess</p>
<p>I&#8217;m following your soul step by step on its way of joy<br />
And I amuse myself by leaning over your starry sleep</p>
<p>Sleep, my love<br />
The sun is still far from the day<br />
We have all the time to love<br />
And the night understands us</p>
<p>Sleep, my love<br />
Protected by my arms that surround<br />
Your sleep with a curtain of happiness<br />
Sleep onto my heart</p>
<p>I hear the voice of your life that beats so close to me<br />
And I feel like a very gentle blow that caresses my cheek</p>
<p>Sleep, my love<br />
My princess, locked up in her tower<br />
I see the morning smile<br />
Here&#8217;s the sun of tomorrow<br />
The great sun of the eternal love<br />
