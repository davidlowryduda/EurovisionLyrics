It was a melancholy day, it might happen to you tomorrow<br />
I was walking around in the streets aimlessly and thinking about nothing<br />
When I perceived her, she came to me<br />
It&#8217;s unbelievable, but it&#8217;s true</p>
<p>She had all the trump cards in her game<br />
And the skills up to her fingertips<br />
Arguments, as much as you want<br />
Put me up to anything</p>
<p>She had this funny little look, as if she wasn&#8217;t really one<br />
She smiled at me, being sure of its effect</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t believe there could be<br />
Toys like that on earth<br />
It was a dream to see that little sweetie there<br />
Not much higher than that</p>
<p>With crupled eyes as they say it in songs<br />
And all you need to do to please boys</p>
<p>And it was a love story, a story with a happy ending<br />
And as this always happens I married her one beautiful morning<br />
And the evening came, I didn&#8217;t dare to think about it<br />
It&#8217;s unbelievable, but know</p>
<p>She had all the trump cards in her game<br />
And the skills up to her fingertips<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take a long time to say it<br />
She put me up to anything</p>
<p>She had this funny little look, as if she wasn&#8217;t really one<br />
She smiled at me, being sure of its effect</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t believe there could be<br />
Toys like that on earth<br />
It was a dream to see that little sweetie there<br />
Curled up in my arms</p>
<p>With crupled eyes as they say it in songs<br />
And all you need to do to please boys<br />
And all that can make you go mad<br />
And all you can&#8217;t say in songs<br />
