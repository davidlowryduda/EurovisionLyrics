They chose Miss Germany, Miss France and Miss Italy<br />
There are also Miss Fashion and Miss Leg<br />
But since everybody likes music and there is no Miss Jukebox yet<br />
I just want to be Miss Jukebox for once</p>
<p>Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And everyday life fades away when happy music is played<br />
Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And for this little money, a world belongs to you</p>
<p>Do you want quiet music? Do you want hot music?<br />
Or do you find a minor key just wonderful?<br />
Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And for this little money, a world belongs to you</p>
<p>Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And everyday life fades away when happy music is played<br />
Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And for this little money, a world belongs to you</p>
<p>May it be music of Dixieland or songs from the Rhine?<br />
Or do you prefer Verdi&#8217;s operas?<br />
Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And for this little money, a world belongs to you</p>
<p>Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And for this little money, a world belongs to you</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the man at the piano, here&#8217;s the march, so are we<br />
Here&#8217;s the woodsman who sings when the home bells ring<br />
Twopenny music, twopenny music<br />
And for this little money, a world belongs to you<br />
