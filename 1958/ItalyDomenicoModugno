I think such a dream will never come back<br />
I painted my hands and my face blue<br />
Then suddenly I was ravished by the wind<br />
And I started flying in the infinite sky</p>
<p>Flying, oh ho&#8230;<br />
Singing, oh ho ho ho&#8230;<br />
Blue painted in the blue<br />
Happy to be up there</p>
<p>And I was flying, flying happily<br />
Higher than the sun and even higher<br />
While the world was slowly disappearing, far beneath<br />
A soft music was playing just for me</p>
<p>Flying, oh ho&#8230;<br />
Singing, oh ho ho ho&#8230;<br />
Blue painted in the blue<br />
Happy to be up there</p>
<p>But all the dreams fade away at dawn, because<br />
While setting, the moon takes them away<br />
But I keep dreaming in your beautiful eyes<br />
Which are as blue as a sky quilted with stars</p>
<p>Flying, oh ho&#8230;<br />
Singing, oh ho ho ho&#8230;<br />
In the blue of your blue eyes<br />
Happy to be down here</p>
<p>And I keep flying happily<br />
Higher than the sun and even higher<br />
While the world is slowly disappearing in your blue eyes<br />
Your voice is a soft music playing for me</p>
<p>Flying, oh ho&#8230;<br />
Singing, oh ho ho ho&#8230;<br />
In the blue of your blue eyes<br />
Happy to be down here</p>
<p>In the blue of your blue eyes<br />
Happy to be down here with you<br />
