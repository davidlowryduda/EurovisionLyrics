<p>Night over countryside and town, sleeping houses<br />
The windows glitter, because of the star light<br />
A girl standing by the window, looking up to the blue<br />
Just fifteen years old, but still she&#8217;s thinking</p>
<p>Little star up above, answer me, answer me<br />
Is he coming, the man that I will love? Yes, you&#8217;ll probably know who he is<br />
Will I read in his eye, the same answer, the same answer<br />
That I think I see you twinkling to me now, you, little star?</p>
<p>Is he coming? Is he coming?<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ll probably know who he is</p>
<p>Will I read in his eye, the same answer, the same answer<br />
That I think I see you twinkling to me now, you, little star?<br />
