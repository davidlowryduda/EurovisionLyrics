A great love, that begins<br />
Without thinking about it most of the time<br />
And we listen to a romance<br />
Born from a stirring silence</p>
<p>Because you know when we love each other<br />
Even words are too much<br />
What&#8217;s the use of dreaming of a poem?<br />
The supreme moment is much nicer</p>
<p>Eyes which are turning away quickly<br />
And then hesitate to come back<br />
To the eyes that tempt<br />
And invite them to smile</p>
<p>That is how love imposes itself<br />
And suggests something crazy to you<br />
We don&#8217;t live love in prose<br />
We transpose it in poetry</p>
<p>A great love, alas, is ending<br />
Like a nice dream in a sigh<br />
Again worries trouble you<br />
The sweet rest comes to an end</p>
<p>What does it matter that life is short<br />
And that its vigour runs out one day<br />
If friendship takes over<br />
When a great love ends</p>
<p>If friendship takes over<br />
When a great love ends<br />
