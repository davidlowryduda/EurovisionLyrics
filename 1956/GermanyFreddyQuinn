On Sunday with Jimmy, on Monday with Jack<br />
On Tuesday you go off with Johnny</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
I&#8217;ve never, never thought that of you</p>
<p>I give you flowers and drive you to the office<br />
Take your mother every Sunday to the zoo<br />
But on Wednesday Billy brings you home<br />
And on Thursday you go out with Tommy</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
I&#8217;ve never, never thought that of you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve loved you since you were a baby<br />
Now I&#8217;ve been practicing the boogie and the cha-cha-cha<br />
But on Friday, on Friday you&#8217;re dancing with Ben<br />
Saturday with someone I don&#8217;t even know</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
I&#8217;ve never, never thought that of you</p>
<p>But if you were thinking I&#8217;ve been sitting at home<br />
I&#8217;ve been going out with someone else every day</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
That&#8217;s how it is every night (That&#8217;s how it is every night)<br />
You&#8217;ve never, never thought that of me<br />
