The first red rose has already blossomed<br />
And sweet-smelling violets shyly come up<br />
The first swallow is back by now<br />
It&#8217;s starting to whirl in the clear sky<br />
It comes to announce nice weather</p>
<p>Open your windows to the newly born sun<br />
It&#8217;s spring, it&#8217;s spring<br />
Let a little fresh air in<br />
With the smell of gardens and flowery meadows</p>
<p>Open your windows to new dreams<br />
Beautiful little girls in love<br />
It&#8217;s maybe the most beautiful dream you dream<br />
Tomorrow it will be happiness</p>
<p>In the sky, among the silver clouds<br />
The moon has already set a date<br />
Open your windows to the newly born sun<br />
It&#8217;s spring, the festival of love</p>
<p>La lalala lala lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Open your windows to the newly born sun</p>
<p>On the window-sill a small nightingale<br />
With tender wings and soft feathers<br />
Has already shyly flown up<br />
And it&#8217;s started tapping on the glass<br />
It wants to bring its most beautiful message:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s spring, it&#8217;s spring</p>
<p>Open your windows to new dreams<br />
To hope, to illusion<br />
Let the last song in<br />
It will softly go down into your heart</p>
<p>In the sky, among the silver clouds<br />
The moon has already set a date<br />
Open your windows to the new sun<br />
It&#8217;s spring, the festival of love</p>
<p>La lalala lala lalala lala&#8230;<br />
Open your windows to the first love<br />
