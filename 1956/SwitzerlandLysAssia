(Refrain of love&#8230;)</p>
<p>Refrain, colour of the sky, the scent of my twenties<br />
Garden full of sun where I spent my childhood<br />
Everywhere I&#8217;ve been looking for you, my distant love<br />
Waiting along the path where you took my hand</p>
<p>The days passed away and we grew up<br />
Love wounded us, time cured us<br />
But lonesome and without spring I run in vain through the woods, the fields<br />
Say, do you remember our old loves?</p>
<p>The years pass away as quick as lightning<br />
And upon the roofs of my concern pours the rain<br />
Where did the caravels leave, stealing my heart<br />
Carrying my dreams away from your memory?</p>
<p>I wanted you to come back like bygone<br />
Carrying flowers to my shutter<br />
And your youthfulness to my home</p>
<p>Refrain, colour of the rain, regret of my twenties<br />
Sorrow, melancholy not to be a child anymore<br />
But lonesome and far from you, along the roads where you are not<br />
I go, crying the loves of my twenties<br />
