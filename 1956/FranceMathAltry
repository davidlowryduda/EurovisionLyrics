Sing, carillon, the song of lost time<br />
Sing your song to my fiery heart<br />
I cry for the one I love</p>
<p>Lull in the evening my dream and my sobs<br />
Pour in me the hope to meet him soon<br />
Hurry up, because I&#8217;m still waiting</p>
<p>May come the time of happiness<br />
The time of love, which only can calm down my heart</p>
<p>Divert the river into the sea that is waiting for you<br />
Cherish in these waters all life of springtime<br />
I will always wait for your return</p>
<p>The hours flee slowly in the night<br />
Every hour rings monotonously<br />
And I&#8217;m waiting for the day, always imagining<br />
That you will give back your love to me one day</p>
<p>Sing, carillon, sing for my happiness<br />
Sing your song, so softly to my heart<br />
Also sing for the one I love</p>
<p>Lull in the evening our love embraces<br />
Pour in me the hope to keep him forever<br />
Sing, I forget the lost time</p>
<p>Ring, but you don&#8217;t have to hurry<br />
The hour of love keeps us clasped</p>
<p>Divert the river into the sea that is waiting for you<br />
Cherish in these waters all life of springtime<br />
I will always wait for your return<br />
