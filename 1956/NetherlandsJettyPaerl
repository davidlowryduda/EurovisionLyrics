The birds of Holland are so musical<br />
They already learn to twitter in their early youth<br />
The blackbird, the thrush and the nightingale<br />
So they can celebrate spring in Holland</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder, because nowhere the puddles are so blue<br />
As in Holland, sir<br />
As in Holland, madam</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder, because nowhere the grass is so full of dew<br />
Are the girls so sweet, are the girls so faithfull<br />
And that&#8217;s why all the birds here are<br />
So musical, so musical, so musical</p>
<p>Across the whole world I&#8217;ve heard birds sing<br />
To the south, to the west, to the north<br />
In many faraway countries I&#8217;ve heard birds sing<br />
They sing little songs without words</p>
<p>The French birds sing toodledoo<br />
Japanese birds sing toodledoo<br />
Chinese birds sing toodledoo<br />
But nowhere the birds sing so happily and cheerfully<br />
As in Holland in spring in the meadow</p>
<p>The birds of Holland are so musical<br />
They already learn to twitter in their early youth<br />
The blackbird, the thrush and the nightingale<br />
So they can celebrate the spring in Holland</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder, because nowhere the puddles are so blue<br />
As in Holland, sir<br />
As in Holland, madam</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder, because nowhere the grass is so full of dew<br />
Are the girls so sweet, are the girls so faithfull<br />
And that&#8217;s why all the birds here are<br />
So musical, so musical, so musical<br />
