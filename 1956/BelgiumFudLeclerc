The drowned men of the river Seine<br />
Open the water gates for me<br />
I&#8217;m tired of spending my weeks<br />
On the black paving of Puteaux</p>
<p>The drowned men of the river Seine<br />
Open the water gates for me<br />
I&#8217;ve been travelling so long under its woollen sky<br />
So the wind has burnt my skin</p>
<p>I&#8217;m married to misery forever<br />
I&#8217;ve never known better than love on a stone bed<br />
The sun for the rich, the moon for the clochards<br />
Why playing the game, when everyone cheats?</p>
<p>The drowned men of the river Seine<br />
Open the water gates for me<br />
I&#8217;m tired of only having for heaven<br />
The rusty bridges of Puteaux</p>
<p>The drowned men of the river Seine<br />
I&#8217;ve watched the boats so much<br />
That from Aubervilliers to Bourg-la-Reine<br />
I&#8217;m carrying Paris on my back</p>
<p>The girl I loved, never loved me<br />
The friends I had, have all left me<br />
I&#8217;m travelling around the world to find springtime<br />
But since the earth is round, it might take a long time</p>
<p>The drowned men of the river Seine<br />
Open the water gates for me<br />
I&#8217;m tired of watching the strange appearance<br />
Of the betrayed children of Puteaux</p>
<p>The drowned men of the river Seine<br />
Paris owes me a cradle<br />
I&#8217;ll fall asleep without love and hate<br />
Between its arms of sand and water<br />
