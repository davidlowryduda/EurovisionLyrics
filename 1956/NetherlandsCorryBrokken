Over for good, now we&#8217;ll never be together again<br />
My darling, what have I done to you?<br />
Over for good, your windows are closed<br />
But just like then I still see violets</p>
<p>The whole world smells good, the spring-flower is colouring<br />
Ah, why is there every year a new May?<br />
For me, it&#8217;s over forever, the spring of my life<br />
That season of mirth, it&#8217;s all over</p>
<p>For you it was just a game, I know very well that<br />
You didn&#8217;t mean it that way<br />
But me, I did mean it<br />
I felt it very deeply</p>
<p>The whole world smells good, the spring-flower is colouring<br />
Ah, why is there every year a new May?<br />
For me, it&#8217;s over forever, the spring of my life<br />
That season of mirth, it&#8217;s all over<br />
