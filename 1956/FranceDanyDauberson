I can&#8217;t change my life, he&#8217;s there<br />
As soon as I run away from him, he&#8217;s there<br />
Whatever I do, whatever I say, I only see his smile<br />
Which always seems to say to me: &#8220;I&#8217;m there, I&#8217;m there&#8221;</p>
<p>Clung in all my dreams, he&#8217;s there<br />
And forcing my attention unremittingly, he&#8217;s there<br />
He has the power of a devil who rules over his fellows<br />
But what a wonderful power, he&#8217;s there, he&#8217;s there</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried everything to forget him<br />
I&#8217;ve crossed the whole world<br />
But no man has given me<br />
Such a part of eternity</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t change my life, he&#8217;s there<br />
As soon as I run away from him, he&#8217;s there<br />
He&#8217;s extraordinary, and how he knows to please you then<br />
No, there&#8217;s nothing to do, he&#8217;s there, he&#8217;s there</p>
<p>Everywhere his eyes, everywhere his lips<br />
I feel like I have a fever inside of me<br />
My whole being is destroyed<br />
And all the time I repeat to myself:</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t change my life, he&#8217;s there<br />
As soon as I run away from him, he&#8217;s there<br />
Whatever I do, whatever I say, I only see his smile<br />
Which always seems to say to me: &#8220;I&#8217;m there, I&#8217;m there&#8221;</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m walking in the street, he&#8217;s there<br />
In the middle of the crush, I see him<br />
He has a hold on me which frightens me and carries me away<br />
And my desire breaks down, he&#8217;s there, he&#8217;s there</p>
<p>Oh, I really tried everything<br />
Forever able to do without<br />
His body and his kisses<br />
It&#8217;s impossible not to love him</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t change my life, he&#8217;s there<br />
As soon as I run away from him, he&#8217;s there<br />
And until my last hour, until my last quarter<br />
Only one thing will remain</p>
<p>I will see him there in front of me, he will be there forever<br />
He&#8217;s there, he&#8217;s there, he&#8217;s there<br />
He&#8217;s there</p>
<p>He&#8217;s there<br />
