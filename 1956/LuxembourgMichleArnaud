Midnight lovers, by chance meet together<br />
By chance meet together<br />
And, about what will follow, happiness or unfortunate<br />
Only knows the night</p>
<p>At the corner of two streets, at a caf√© tables<br />
On the avenue, two shadows had come<br />
And then, the die is cast</p>
<p>No pointless words, no lost kisses<br />
No lost kisses<br />
No difficult confessions, nor dejected heart<br />
Nor disappointing romance</p>
<p>At dawn no return<br />
Lovers unlearn their names and their loves<br />
It is quite the equal of mine, worn out by so many days</p>
<p>Midnight lovers, by chance meet together<br />
By chance meet together<br />
And, about what will followed, happiness or unfortunate<br />
Only knows the night</p>
<p>And if their heart gave themselves a little bit more than one night<br />
There will be nobody, nobody between her and him<br />
To shout them misdeal</p>
<p>Midnight lovers, by chance meet together<br />
By chance meet together<br />
