I really like caressing you<br />
Kissing your shy eyes<br />
But I don&#8217;t feel like swearing<br />
If you ask me for eternal love</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s give ourselves up to destiny<br />
He&#8217;s the only one who can&#8217;t cheat<br />
And if I stay near you<br />
Don&#8217;t flatter yourself, but don&#8217;t despair, no</p>
<p>Love me if you want to, hold me if you can<br />
I&#8217;m the love that fades away<br />
But never trust my kisses<br />
I&#8217;m the love that hurts</p>
<p>And when you hold me softly in your arms<br />
Even more softly, I&#8217;ll say to you:<br />
&#8220;Love me if you want to, hold me if you can<br />
Because I&#8217;m like this&#8221;</p>
<p>And if I stay near you<br />
Don&#8217;t flatter yourself, but don&#8217;t despair, no</p>
<p>Love me if you want to, hold me if you can<br />
I&#8217;m the love that fades away<br />
But never trust my kisses<br />
I&#8217;m the love that hurts</p>
<p>And when you hold me softly in your arms<br />
Even more softly, I will say to you:<br />
&#8220;Love me if you want to, hold me if you can<br />
Because I&#8217;m like this&#8221;<br />
