There is a harbour where hardly a ship sails<br />
And when one does, it sails to the undetermined distance<br />
And it comes, when it arrives, from very far away<br />
And someone gets out and comes across the sea<br />
With a cargo from the stars made of glass</p>
<p>And they built on the quay of the past<br />
A room with a seaview<br />
And with walls made of dreams to combat reality<br />
Because they didn&#8217;t like it much</p>
<p>In the waiting room for great luck many, many people are waiting<br />
They&#8217;re waiting since yesterday for tomorrow&#8217;s luck<br />
And living with wishes for the day after tomorrow<br />
And forgetting that it&#8217;s still today<br />
Oh&#8230; those poor, poor people</p>
<p>And they looked at the sea and they also saw the ship<br />
Just as it was leaving for the undetermined distance<br />
And they chased it right behind on their dreams<br />
And didn&#8217;t see him coming across the sea<br />
With a cargo from the stars made of glass</p>
<p>And he passed along the quay of the past<br />
And simply ignored the people in the room<br />
Went straight out into reality<br />
And there people saw him smiling</p>
<p>In the waiting room for great luck many, many people are waiting<br />
They&#8217;re waiting since yesterday for tomorrow&#8217;s luck<br />
And living with wishes for the day after tomorrow<br />
And forgetting that it&#8217;s still today<br />
Hah&#8230; those poor, poor people</p>
<p>And the fishermen sailed out in the morning<br />
And the sky glowed into the undetermined distance<br />
And then he came by and their nets were empty<br />
Yet he raised the sun out of the sea for them<br />
And carried it up to the stars</p>
<p>And it shone all through reality<br />
And the boats danced in the light<br />
Only in the room on the quay of the past<br />
Was the sun not seen at all</p>
<p>In the waiting room for great luck many, many people are waiting<br />
They&#8217;re waiting since yesterday for tomorrow&#8217;s luck<br />
And living with wishes for the day after tomorrow<br />
And forgetting that it&#8217;s still today<br />
Well&#8230; those poor people<br />
