<p>(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)<br />
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)</p>
<p>I was strollin&#8217; through the park one evenin&#8217;<br />
When a strange feelin&#8217; came over me<br />
A vision of loveliness came in view<br />
It was love, it was plain to see</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the bells were ringin&#8217;<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the world was singin&#8217;</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s got me in a whirl<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s my ring-a-ding girl</p>
<p>(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)<br />
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)</p>
<p>Very shortly, we were dating steady<br />
I asked her if her love was true<br />
She gave me the answer with her lips<br />
Every time that we kissed, I knew</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the bells were ringin&#8217;<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the world was singin&#8217;</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s got me in a whirl<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s my ring-a-ding girl</p>
<p>(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)<br />
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)</p>
<p>I have waited patiently, my darlin&#8217;<br />
When can we fix the date and the time?<br />
She answer so softly and tenderly:<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait till the day you&#8217;re mine&#8221;</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the bells were ringin&#8217;<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the world was singin&#8217;</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s got me in a whirl<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s my ring-a-ding girl</p>
<p>(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)<br />
(Ring-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding)</p>
<p>We were married and the bells were ringin&#8217;<br />
It&#8217;s a day that I&#8217;ll never forget<br />
I had that strange feelin&#8217; once again<br />
Just the same as the day we met</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the bells were ringin&#8217;<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
All the world was singin&#8217;</p>
<p>Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s got me in a whirl<br />
Ring-ding-a-ding-a-ding, ding-ding<br />
She&#8217;s my ring-a-ding girl</p>
