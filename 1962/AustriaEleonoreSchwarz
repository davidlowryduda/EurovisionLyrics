Only in the air of Vienna you smell that special scent<br />
Of a certain sweet waltz melody<br />
When you look out of your window you hear the sound of Johann Strauss<br />
And the magic of his waltz poetry</p>
<p>And every child of Vienna loves this wind<br />
Rushing and blustering like an imaginative child<br />
Often he can be gentle, often he is stormy like young wine<br />
Magician of Vienna, Waltz of Vienna</p>
<p>St Stephen&#8217;s Cathedral, the city hall man, Sacher cake and sausage vendor<br />
Are well known by every child in the world<br />
About our grilled chicken, Schubert and the National Opera<br />
Grandfather already told</p>
<p>And also the Grinzing and Burgtheater<br />
Schrammeln and the main avenue are our specialities<br />
But one important thing is still missing<br />
You can&#8217;t read it in the Baedecker</p>
<p>Only in the air of Vienna you smell that special scent<br />
Singing and sounding he brings you to Phantasia<br />
Often he can be gentle, often he is stormy like young wine<br />
Magician of Vienna, Waltz of Vienna</p>
<p>And every child of Vienna loves this wind<br />
Rushing and blustering like an imaginative child<br />
Often he can be gentle, often he is stormy like young wine<br />
Waltz of Vienna, yes<br />
