Come sun, come rain, come what may come<br />
As long as you are here<br />
Come sun, come rain, as long as we exist<br />
For you, for me, happiness is always close</p>
<p>Rain becomes sunshine when only you smile at me<br />
The two of us walk along the path of summer<br />
Come sun, some rain, what could happen when I<br />
Have everything I could wish for in you</p>
<p>I hoped many times: A day must come, my day<br />
But the doubt planted seeds of unease in my mind<br />
My world was so stressful, and I went along with its rush<br />
But then you came and then the world was mine</p>
<p>Come sun, come rain, the only thing I know<br />
Our happiness remains with us when we<br />
Hold on to our love<br />
