<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
My smiles and yours are extinguished<br />
We&#8217;re walking together and we&#8217;re alone<br />
There are only long silences left which mean:<br />
Goodbye, goodbye</p>
<p>Our love has become salt like sea water<br />
Our parched lips don&#8217;t have words any longer<br />
Look at me, look at me, you know that it isn&#8217;t true<br />
It isn&#8217;t true that our love has ended</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye<br />
Goodbye, goodbye</p>
<p>Look at me, look at me, listen to me, hold on<br />
It isn&#8217;t true, because you&#8217;re crying</p>
<p>Because we know (Because we know)<br />
That we love each other (That we love each other)<br />
That we love each other and that we&#8217;re breaking up</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye<br />
Goodbye, goodbye<br />
