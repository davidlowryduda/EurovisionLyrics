Say nothing, say nothing, we love each other<br />
That&#8217;s the true poem<br />
And I&#8217;m feeling so well<br />
My body drowning in yours</p>
<p>I&#8217;m as in a wave<br />
Where my happiness roams<br />
It&#8217;s so profound, profound<br />
I feel myself streaming in the depths</p>
<p>Say nothing, words are silly<br />
For someone who isn&#8217;t a poet<br />
They&#8217;re bubbles that blow<br />
The words, it kills the dreams</p>
<p>My hands play on your dress<br />
Nothing of you is revealed<br />
In my two closed arms<br />
Let me, let me love you</p>
<p>Say nothing, say nothing, my soul<br />
Your eyes possess it like a flame<br />
The words are all the same<br />
Say nothing, say nothing, I love you</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know anymore where we are<br />
You are a woman and I &#8211; a man<br />
And if one dies of that<br />
I want to die a hundred times<br />
A hundred times, a hundred times, a hundred times<br />
