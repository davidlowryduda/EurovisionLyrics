In the warm darkness of the room, two cigarettes<br />
Two tiny lights are closer and closer<br />
This night is made for them, this dream is so slow and quiet<br />
Two stars will now depart on a long journey</p>
<p>In the blue glass of the vase, under the roses<br />
Two tiny lights are closer and closer<br />
That day was so quiet, now sleep is descending upon them<br />
You&#8217;re putting out your cigarette, embracing sleep</p>
<p>That day was so quiet, now sleep is descending upon them<br />
Two stars will depart on a long journey</p>
<p>In the blue glass of the vase, under the roses<br />
Two tiny lights are closer and closer<br />
This night is made for them, now sleep is coming, so quiet<br />
You&#8217;re putting out your cigarette, embracing sleep</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t turn the lights on at twilight<br />
