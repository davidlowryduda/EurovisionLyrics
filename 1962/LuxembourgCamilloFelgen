Little boy, at the end of your childhood<br />
Little boy, you&#8217;ll have to quit<br />
You&#8217;ll leave like someone goes on holiday<br />
On the paths of liberty</p>
<p>Little boy, that&#8217;s how life leads us<br />
And the children escape from their parents<br />
I had joy, soon I will have pain<br />
And I&#8217;ll understand you, I love you and I wait for you</p>
<p>I hear you sleeping and your childhood dreams<br />
Are memories for me for when you&#8217;ll be grown-up<br />
Bigger than me, tomorrow already</p>
<p>Little boy, I hqve to tell you<br />
Little boy, and you won&#8217;t believe it<br />
But sometimes I packed my suitcases<br />
And quickly unpacked them because of you</p>
<p>Little boy, at the day of the great path<br />
I will be alone and you won&#8217;t come<br />
But I&#8217;ll say: &#8220;My son is on a journey&#8221;<br />
&#8220;He went a lot further, a lot further than me&#8221;<br />
