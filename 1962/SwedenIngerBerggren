A jeweller and his shop<br />
Is the reason why everything is so gloomy<br />
One day I was standing in front of his window<br />
When someone suddenly said &#8216;good day&#8217;</p>
<p>It was a happy young man with a charming smile<br />
Who asked me to come in to give my advice<br />
He was looking for something to give to his fianc√©e<br />
And I was nice enough and joined him</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s sun and spring and you&#8217;re nineteen years old<br />
You understand so little<br />
And all the little girls should be locked up then<br />
When winter turns to sun and spring</p>
<p>Once in the shop he couldn&#8217;t find anything<br />
And soon we were outside again<br />
I said &#8216;goodbye&#8217; and had begun walking<br />
When he yelled: &#8220;Wait, listen&#8221;</p>
<p>As a proof of his gratitude<br />
He wanted to buy me lunch somewhere<br />
It was the first sunny day of spring<br />
So I was stupid enough to say yes</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s sun and spring and you&#8217;re nineteen years old<br />
You understand so little<br />
And all the little girls should be locked up then<br />
When winter turns to sun and spring</p>
<p>He conversed with elegance<br />
And bought me the best meal the place had to offer<br />
But then he went to call a friend<br />
And didn&#8217;t come back</p>
<p>And the man working in the cloakroom said:<br />
&#8220;Yes, your husband took your fur coat<br />
And went to the tailor&#8221;<br />
So I had to call my own Knut<br />
Who came and bailed me out</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s sun and spring and you&#8217;re nineteen years old<br />
You understand so little<br />
And all the little girls should be locked up then<br />
When winter turns to sun and spring<br />
