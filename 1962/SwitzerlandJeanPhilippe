After the time of beating hearts<br />
Rough roads, light steps<br />
After the long stay of the distant beautiful days<br />
Everyone gets his turn, it&#8217;s the return</p>
<p>We&#8217;re grown old in good times<br />
For our four hundred times, a bit much<br />
And there you see where the short walk brought us<br />
Everyone gets his turn, it&#8217;s the return</p>
<p>We told him: &#8220;You have to know that youth passes by&#8221;<br />
He understood when his mirror pulled him a long face<br />
He threw the prime of his life away<br />
At the same time as his knowledge</p>
<p>By searching too much, we wasted<br />
What we had better kept in our eyes<br />
And there you see where the short walk brought us<br />
Everyone gets his turn, it&#8217;s the return</p>
<p>But the other time that wait for us<br />
Will be worth other joys with you, with me<br />
It&#8217;s the time without detour, the time of love<br />
Everyone gets his turn, it&#8217;s the return</p>
<p>Yes, the return of new days<br />
