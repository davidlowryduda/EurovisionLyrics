Every morning, at half past eight we meet Katinka<br />
Red bonnet and blond locks, bright yellow shirt, blue skirt<br />
But she trips silently beside her mum<br />
That&#8217;s why all the boys who long for her, sing</p>
<p>Little coquettish Katinka<br />
Now, look round for once<br />
Sneaky over your shoulder<br />
Your mum doesn&#8217;t see it, so come on</p>
<p>Little coquettish Katinka<br />
Are you maybe shy?<br />
We really want to see for a moment<br />
A glimpse of your tip-tilted nose</p>
<p>Every morning, sun or rain, we meet Katinka<br />
Heels tick-tack on the sidewalk, short skirt with narrow cut<br />
But her look doesn&#8217;t betray no or yes<br />
That&#8217;s why all the boys who long for her, sing</p>
<p>Little coquettish Katinka, now, look round for once<br />
Sneaky over your shoulder, your mum doesn&#8217;t see it, so come on<br />
Little coquettish Katinka, are you maybe shy?<br />
We really want to see for a moment a glimpse of your tip-tilted nose</p>
<p>Little coquettish Katinka<br />
Now, look round for once<br />
Sneaky over your shoulder<br />
Your mum doesn&#8217;t see it, so come on</p>
<p>Little coquettish Katinka<br />
Are you maybe shy?<br />
We really want to see for a moment<br />
A glimpse of your tip-tilted nose</p>
<p>La la, la la la, la la la<br />
La la, la la la, la la la<br />
La la, la la la, la la la<br />
La la, la la la, la la la<br />
