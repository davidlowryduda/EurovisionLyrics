A first love, first love, first love<br />
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten<br />
A first love, we always look for it<br />
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life</p>
<p>It confused us and made us dream and made us tremble<br />
That first love, first love, first love<br />
But the child that we are, the child that we remained<br />
Will always hum in memory of this love</p>
<p>And you, and you who I loved<br />
What did you make of yourself?<br />
What have you done without me?</p>
<p>And I, I who lost you<br />
What have I done more?<br />
Was I so much more lucky?<br />
Did we actually know&#8230;</p>
<p>That a first love, first love, first love<br />
Is never forgotten, never forgotten, never forgotten?<br />
That a first love, we always look for it<br />
In other loves, we pursue it our whole life?</p>
<p>That all those kisses that we have stolen rather than given<br />
Those innocent gestures engaged us for so long?<br />
No, the children that we still were back then<br />
Didn&#8217;t suspect much, they were delighted<br />
That a first love, their first love was so strong<br />
