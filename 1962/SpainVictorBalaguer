(Call me, call me)</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the pruned branch<br />
In the tree of my dreams<br />
Love that is nothing<br />
But it&#8217;s you</p>
<p>Call me, call me if you cry<br />
Call me if you lose the route of your life<br />
Count always on me<br />
Like the friend that never forgets</p>
<p>Call me, call me if you suffer<br />
Call me if you feel that the world abandons you<br />
Call me and your sin will be forgotten<br />
By just saying &#8216;come&#8217;</p>
<p>Call me if you need me<br />
If you see the open abyss at your feet<br />
Call me if you are lost<br />
But don&#8217;t ask me to believe in you again</p>
<p>Call me if you need me<br />
If you see the open abyss at your feet<br />
Call me if you&#8217;re lost<br />
But don&#8217;t ask me to believe in you again</p>
<p>Call me if you cry<br />
If you need me, call me<br />
