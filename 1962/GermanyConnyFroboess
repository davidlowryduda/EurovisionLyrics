For others a journey to the South is something chic and fine<br />
But two little Italians would rather be back home</p>
<p>Two little Italians, dreaming of Naples<br />
Of Tina and Marina, who&#8217;ve been waiting for them a long time<br />
Two little Italians, all on their own<br />
For others a journey to the South is something chic and fine<br />
But both Italians would rather be back home</p>
<p>Oh Tina, oh Marina, if we get to see each other again<br />
Oh Tina, oh Marina, then it will be wonderful again</p>
<p>Two little Italians never forget their home<br />
The palm trees and the girls on the beach of Naples<br />
Two little Italians, they understand<br />
That for others, a journey to the South is something chic and fine<br />
But both Italians would rather be back home</p>
<p>Oh Tina, oh Marina, if we get to see each other again<br />
Oh Tina, oh Marina, then it will be wonderful again</p>
<p>Two little Italians at the station, everyone knows them there<br />
They come every evening for the express train to Naples<br />
Two little Italians, looking at the train as it leaves<br />
For others a journey to the South is something chic and fine<br />
But both Italians would rather be back home</p>
<p>Oh Tina, oh Marina, if we get to see each other again<br />
Oh Tina, oh Marina, then it will be wonderful again<br />
