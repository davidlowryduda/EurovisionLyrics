A day will dawn upon three branches of lilac<br />
That a child will watch like a picture book<br />
The world around him will be empty, and it&#8217;s like this<br />
That he&#8217;ll invent life on his first page:</p>
<p>Drawing the shape of an orange<br />
He&#8217;ll give the sky its first sun<br />
Drawing the bird, he&#8217;ll invent the flower<br />
Looking for the sound of water, he&#8217;ll hear the heartfelt cry</p>
<p>Drawing the rays of a star<br />
The child will find the road of grown-ups<br />
Grown-ups who kept a surprising look<br />
For everyday fruit and for the roses of love<br />
