Our heart, you always said<br />
Is not a room that you rent out<br />
We left each other, the room is empty<br />
The door will stay open</p>
<p>Two big white tears<br />
Like two pearls from the sea<br />
Is all for me that&#8217;s left from you</p>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t die because of love<br />
Not to hear your voice<br />
I&#8217;ll hide my head under my pillow</p>
<p>Like a flash that opens the sky<br />
I saw clearly in the middle of the dark<br />
No, you don&#8217;t die only because of love<br />
Laughing, you said that to me</p>
<p>Two big white tears<br />
Like two pearls from the sea<br />
Is all for me that&#8217;s left from you</p>
<p>Two big white tears<br />
That won&#8217;t make a noise<br />
Because the last ones are never heavy, you know<br />
