London City was dreaming silently in the sun<br />
Dreaming of the sea in the sun around me<br />
Where I went along the edges of the lawn<br />
Stood the trees gloriously in the sun</p>
<p>And then you came, Jennifer Jennings<br />
And danced by, as sweet as spring<br />
You came, Jennifer Jennings<br />
And blue eyes, that smiled at me<br />
t me, only at me</p>
<p>Then you took me out through the city<br />
Along the dreams that you had, soft as silk<br />
And ever since, my dreams are coming back every time<br />
To all those ancient dreams of you and me</p>
<p>And then you come, Jennifer Jennings<br />
As freshly and playfully as love, so happily<br />
Because you, Jennifer Jennings<br />
You are exactly what I dreamt for me</p>
<p>Yes, then you come, Jennifer Jennings<br />
And blue eyes, that smiled at me<br />
But you, Jennifer Jennings<br />
You were dancing by, time and time again<br />
By, always by</p>
<p>Each time by<br />
Hopelessly by<br />
