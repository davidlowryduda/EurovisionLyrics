Judy, my friend, you seem so thoughtful, why, Judy, my friend?<br />
Judy, my friend, you are silent and sad, why, Judy, my friend?<br />
Are you beginning to realize that you and I<br />
May never be happy together, Judy, my friend?</p>
<p>Judy, my friend, you love things, house, TV and car<br />
Your path is surrounded by luxury and gadgets, that&#8217;s not my style<br />
Our lifestyles are different, let me put it this way:<br />
I can never be the man that you need, Judy, my friend</p>
<p>What am I like? Let me explain<br />
I live for the moment, I&#8217;m just a dreamer<br />
That&#8217;s my philosophy<br />
I want to feel: I&#8217;m free</p>
<p>Judy, my friend, your dream of money seems small and narrow<br />
My dream is the dream of green meadows, the playful wind and a song</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll change<br />
Then I&#8217;ll get in touch<br />
Then I&#8217;ll introduce myself<br />
As your Mister Average</p>
<p>Judy, my friend, here we go our own ways, maybe we&#8217;ll meet again<br />
Then we&#8217;ll see what life has done to us, Judy, my friend</p>
<p>What am I like? Let me explain<br />
I live for the moment, I&#8217;m just a dreamer<br />
That&#8217;s my philosophy<br />
I want to feel: I&#8217;m free</p>
<p>Judy, my friend, here we go our own ways, maybe we&#8217;ll meet again<br />
Then we&#8217;ll see what life has done to us, Judy, my friend<br />
Judy, my friend, Judy, my friend<br />
