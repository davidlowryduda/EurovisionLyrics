<p>Look before you leap right into love, my friend<br />
It cannot be bought so very cheap, my friend<br />
Love that makes you laugh, love that makes you cry<br />
Before you really understand it<br />
It can make you live, it can make you die</p>
<p>There will be bridges to be crossed<br />
And there&#8217;ll be teardrops to be lost<br />
Or you will have to pay the cost<br />
Just wait and see, oh yeah</p>
<p>There are many rainbows on the way<br />
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey<br />
So when you fall in love, you pay<br />
The wages of love, the wages of love, the wages of love</p>
<p>Just take my advice, don&#8217;t be a fool, my friend<br />
When you fall in love, you go to school, my friend<br />
Lessons must get learned, fingers must get burned<br />
Before you really understand it<br />
Love is very nice if you pay the price</p>
<p>There will be bridges to be crossed<br />
And there&#8217;ll be teardrops to be lost<br />
Or you will have to pay the cost<br />
Just wait and see, oh yeah</p>
<p>There are many rainbows on the way (On the way)<br />
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey (Maybe grey)<br />
So when you fall in love, you pay<br />
The wages of love, the wages of love, the wages of love</p>
<p>There will be bridges to be crossed (To be crossed)<br />
And there&#8217;ll be teardrops to be lost (To be lost)<br />
Or you will have to pay the cost<br />
Just wait and see</p>
<p>There are many rainbows on the way (On the way)<br />
Days are maybe bright or maybe grey (Maybe grey)<br />
So when you fall in love, you pay<br />
The wages of love, the wages of love, the wages of love</p>
