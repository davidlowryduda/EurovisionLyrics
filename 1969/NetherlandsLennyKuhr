He was bursting with music<br />
He sang for large and small public<br />
He changed happiness to melancholy<br />
The troubadour</p>
<p>For knights in the Knight&#8217;s Hall<br />
He sang in tough, strong language<br />
A long and bloody story<br />
The troubadour</p>
<p>But also the workmen in the barn<br />
Heard his song full of adventure<br />
Heard nearby the nightly kitchenfire<br />
The troubadour, the troubadour</p>
<p>And in the inn of the city<br />
He sang a drinking song on the dampness<br />
For those who could still stand and those who sat<br />
The troubadour, the troubadour</p>
<p>La lalala lala lailala lailala&#8230;<br />
La lala lailala la&#8230;<br />
La lalala lala lailala lailala&#8230;<br />
La lala lailala la&#8230;</p>
<p>He silently sung his song in monestries<br />
About a miracle that occurs<br />
Even if nobody sees the wonder<br />
The troubadour</p>
<p>Women dressed in velvet or grey<br />
Whose hearts he sang into confusion<br />
His love song was brought along on trips<br />
The troubadour</p>
<p>He sang for farmers on the land<br />
A fellow song he wrote himself<br />
He was from all walks of life<br />
The troubadour, the troubadour</p>
<p>Like this he sang his whole life long<br />
His own song, his own singing<br />
But still death just goes its way<br />
The troubadour, the troubadour</p>
<p>Then it went quiet, the song was ended<br />
Only some mud in conclusion<br />
But those who were comforted by his song<br />
Don&#8217;t forget him</p>
<p>Because he was bursting with music<br />
He sang for large and small public<br />
He changed happiness to melancholy<br />
The troubadour</p>
<p>Oh oh&#8230; la lalala lala lailala lailala&#8230;<br />
La lala lailala la&#8230;<br />
La lalala lala lailala lailala&#8230;<br />
La lala lailala la&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; ala lalala lala lailala lailala&#8230;<br />
La lala lailala la&#8230;<br />
Ala lalala lala lailala lailala&#8230;<br />
La lala lailala la&#8230;<br />
Ala ho ho ho&#8230;<br />
</div>
