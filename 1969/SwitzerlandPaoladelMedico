Good day, good day, it&#8217;s wonderful to see you once again<br />
Good day, good day, especially today the sun shines so beautifully<br />
My only wish is to walk through the town led by your hand<br />
Good day, good day</p>
<p>The sky laughs like my heart, when you love me dearly<br />
Flowers are blooming, where previously could be found street dust<br />
A bird sings for us in a minor and a major key:<br />
&#8220;Good day, good day&#8221;</p>
<p>The world is wonderful, it can&#8217;t be more beautiful<br />
And it only belongs to the lovers</p>
<p>Good day, good day, it&#8217;s wonderful to see you once again<br />
Good day, good day, only with you the sun shines so beautifully<br />
My experience with you, that&#8217;s all love<br />
Good day, good day</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, good day&#8221;, says everybody, who sees you and me<br />
Good day, good day, the clock chimes and it stops for us<br />
Soon a monument will take off his hat, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
Good day, good day</p>
<p>The world is wonderful, it can&#8217;t be more beautiful<br />
And it only belongs to the lovers</p>
<p>&#8220;Good day, good day&#8221;, fortune says and it comes to us<br />
In your arms I fly into the sky<br />
Inspite I also know, that after the lucky time<br />
Only loneliness will remain</p>
<p>Good evening, good evening, it was wonderful to see you once again<br />
Though it&#8217;s hard for me to leave you such in love<br />
I dream of you till you come back and then I only say:<br />
&#8220;Good day, good day&#8221;<br />
