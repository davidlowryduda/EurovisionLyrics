Catherine, Catherine, we were ten years old<br />
Do you remember, Catherine? At nursery school<br />
I gave you my bread and my chocolate<br />
With my heart, Catherine, already in love</p>
<p>And when the night closed the garden again<br />
Broke my childish heart to pieces<br />
You left me alone with my sorrow<br />
You dreamed about prince charming</p>
<p>If I laugh, Catherine, I had in my heart<br />
Many laughs, Catherine, sad like my cries</p>
<p>Where are you and prince charming?<br />
Have you found him at last?<br />
Our hearts are always and our names are always there<br />
Engraved on the garden tree</p>
<p>Catherine, Catherine, in the nursery school<br />
Catherine, Catherine, we were ten years old</p>
<p>Catherine, Catherine, I often dream<br />
Before the others, Catherine, in the nursery school<br />
Catherine, Catherine, and in spite of time<br />
I waited for you, Catherine, like before, in the nursery school<br />
Catherine<br />
