Mum, Mum, I had a marvellous dream<br />
Mum, Mum, and I&#8217;ve grown up</p>
<p>I marched in step, helmet, rifle and backpack<br />
In the light of a morning, the sun shone high<br />
It followed me like a friend</p>
<p>Mum, Mum, I had a marvellous dream<br />
Mum, Mum, we both left</p>
<p>On a great ship, all white, a flag floating high<br />
And I was the commander, left for the islands of the wind<br />
You were proud of me, Mum</p>
<p>Mum, Mum, I had a marvellous dream</p>
<p>But suddenly my childhood dream stops<br />
And I see appearing the real adult life<br />
I have time, I have time</p>
<p>Mum, Mum, I had a bad dream<br />
Mum, Mum, I saw your white hair</p>
<p>I want to forget the soldier and the big ship<br />
I want to stay near you and may God save you for a long time<br />
You, the most beautiful of all mums</p>
<p>Mum, Mum, I still want to be a child<br />
Hold me close to you, Mum<br />
Hold me close to you, Mum<br />
