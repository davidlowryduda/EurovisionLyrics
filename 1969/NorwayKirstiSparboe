Wow, wow, wow, how happy I&#8217;ll be<br />
When he no longer has someone on the side<br />
Wow, wow, wow, then I&#8217;ll have a party<br />
And I will be the only guest</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow, how happy I&#8217;ll be<br />
When I can set all the competition free<br />
Wow, wow, wow, alone with you<br />
Yes, that&#8217;s top of the world for me</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got the world&#8217;s most handsome guy, that&#8217;s for sure<br />
But he has too much of an appetite for miniskirt-invites<br />
He runs after Eva, Lise and Anne<br />
Frolicking like a fish in the sea</p>
<p>But every time he sets sails<br />
I dream with all my heart:</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow, how happy I&#8217;ll be<br />
When he no longer has someone on the side<br />
Wow, wow, wow, then I&#8217;ll have a party<br />
And I will be the only guest</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow, how happy I&#8217;ll be<br />
When I can set all the competition free<br />
Wow, wow, wow, alone with you<br />
Yes, that&#8217;s top of the world for me</p>
<p>Lalalala lalalala&#8230; lalala lalalala lalalala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lalalala&#8230; lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lalala lalala&#8230; lalala lalalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow, wow<br />
