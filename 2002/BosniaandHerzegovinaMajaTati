Good morning, my heart is smiling<br />
You I don&#8217;t want, I only sin with you<br />
Comforting words are not necessary<br />
I don&#8217;t love you any more, move away from me, no, no<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>(Yeah, yeah)</em></font></p>
<p>I have that thing called the heart<br />
Because of you, it&#8217;s now looking for tears</p>
<p>On a pillow for two made of illusions<br />
The thoughts are far, miles away<br />
Love is on a journey to shatter someone else&#8217;s dreams</p>
<p>On a pillow for two, I&#8217;m alone now<br />
Steps are moving far, miles away<br />
Love is on a journey to shatter someone else&#8217;s dream<br />
I don&#8217;t know who he is, but I&#8217;ll wait for him</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>(Wala wa pa pa pa&#8230; wala wa pa pa pa&#8230;)<br />
(Wala wa pa pa pa&#8230; wala parapa para pa&#8230;)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Welcome, sister, the club is open, sign in<br />
Take these members, be prepared for crying<br />
I am sad no more, you took away my lonesome blues<br />
I was blind and stupid when I spent my dreams on him<br />
(Yeah, yeah)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And if I ever, if I ever meet him (No, no)<br />
No, I will never, I will never want him (Yeah, yeah)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Fairytales about love – this lady knows so well<br />
There&#8217;s no sound of music in the broken bell, yeah<br />
If someone doesn&#8217;t care about you, don&#8217;t be sad and blue</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Fairytales about love – this lady learnt so well<br />
There&#8217;s no sound of music in the broken bell, yeah<br />
If someone doesn&#8217;t care about you, just don&#8217;t waste your time<br />
Never, never free – you&#8217;d better run away</em></font></p>
