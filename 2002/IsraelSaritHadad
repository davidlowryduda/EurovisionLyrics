<p>Sometimes it seems as if there is no hope<br />
And everything looks so dark and unknown<br />
The flowers have yet to bloom in the garden and in the field<br />
And in the evening only the wind blows<br />
So let&#8217;s light a candle together, candle&#8230;</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Light a candle, light a candle with me<br />
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts<br />
Light a candle, light a candle with me<br />
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts</em></font></p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as if tomorrow<br />
Won&#8217;t bring any comfort here to the crying and the sorrow<br />
And the long night goes on without a promise<br />
And the darkness is sharp as a razor<br />
So let&#8217;s light a candle together, candle&#8230;</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Light a candle, light a candle with me<br />
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts<br />
Light a candle, light a candle with me<br />
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Light all the candles<br />
Let&#8217;s light the candles everywhere<br />
Just look at me and take my hand<br />
The heat of love will glow again</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Light a candle, light a candle with me<br />
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts<br />
Light a candle, light a candle with me<br />
A thousand candles in the dark will open our hearts</em></font><br />
