<p>(Sister, sister, sister, sister) </p>
<p>Once upon a time, I was looking for a girl like you<br />
Like a thunder in the night, felt a fire burning so brand new<br />
She was scared and so much younger and she never learnt of what to do<br />
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you</p>
<p>Sister – come and move your body<br />
Sister – so come on and make my day<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m in love, and I can make you feel this way<br />
That&#8217;s what I wanna say</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&#8217;s what I wanna say, honey<br />
Come on</p>
<p>When a boy becomes a man, guess you better know the chance you take<br />
Don&#8217;t you play your game so fast &#8217;cause a broken heart&#8217;s the price to pay<br />
So let me try and make it better &#8217;cause there&#8217;s so much more that we can do<br />
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you</p>
<p>Sister – come and move your body<br />
Sister – so come on and make my day<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m in love, and I can make you feel this way<br />
Oh baby</p>
<p>Sister – get it right the first time<br />
Sister – don&#8217;t you wait another day<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m in love, and I can make you feel this way<br />
That&#8217;s what I wanna say</p>
<p>(Sister) Let&#8217;s make it better<br />
(Make my day) I just can&#8217;t wait<br />
(Sister) It&#8217;s now or never<br />
(Make my day) Don&#8217;t you walk away</p>
<p>(Sister) Let&#8217;s stick together<br />
(Make my day) Night and day<br />
Baby, won&#8217;t you show me the way?</p>
<p>(Sister) Oh yeah<br />
(Come and move your body) Oh&#8230;<br />
(Sister) So come on and make my day<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re in love, and I can make you feel this way<br />
(Hey, hey) Come on, everybody</p>
<p>Sister – get it right the first time<br />
Sister – don&#8217;t you wait another day<br />
I&#8217;m in love, and I can make you feel this way</p>
<p>Oh baby, sister</p>
