Stay, don&#8217;t go now, stay with me tonight<br />
You&#8217;ve been hurt, I know, please let it stay in the past<br />
My eyes are longing for you<br />
I&#8217;m sad, silent and still<br />
I&#8217;m worn out without you</p>
<p>Stay, don&#8217;t leave now, I&#8217;m lonely inside<br />
I know your heart is broken, lilacs faded in your heart<br />
I walk on the beach, empty without you<br />
I&#8217;m sad, silent and still<br />
I&#8217;m worn out without you</p>
<p>With happiness in your hands (Na nana nana nana&#8230;)<br />
Why are you going away?<br />
Please don&#8217;t go, may this yearning cease<br />
Let us live our love</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Stay, oh, stay, my love, I only ask one more night<br />
Please don&#8217;t go, I know you&#8217;re hurt, lilacs have faded in your heart<br />
Remember those days of love, but now no more<br />
When you&#8217;re gone I&#8217;m so blue<br />
It&#8217;s so sad and lonely without you</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Don&#8217;t ever let love pass you by (Na nana nana nana&#8230;)<br />
Not hard if you will try<br />
Take it now, hold it while you can<br />
You&#8217;ll be lost when love comes to an end</em></font></p>
<p>With happiness in your hands (Na nana nana nana&#8230;)<br />
Why are you going away?<br />
Please don&#8217;t go, may this yearning cease<br />
Let us live our love<br />
