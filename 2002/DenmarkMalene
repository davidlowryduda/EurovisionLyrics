<p>Morning light breaking darkness<br />
Bringing dawn on again<br />
I can feel you are restless<br />
I&#8217;m afraid for day to begin</p>
<p>You are here, still around me<br />
But your mind goes runnin&#8217; free</p>
<p>Tell me who you are, show me what to do<br />
Let me be the one that you hold on to<br />
Open up your heart, let me look inside<br />
Baby, we&#8217;ll go wrong if you try to hide<br />
So tell me who you are</p>
<p>Not a word, not a whisper<br />
I&#8217;m confused, feelin&#8217; low<br />
In my dreams sweet surrender<br />
Through your arms like a river I flow</p>
<p>You are here, still around me<br />
But your mind goes runnin&#8217; free</p>
<p>Tell me who you are, show me what to do<br />
Let me be the one that you hold on to<br />
Open up your heart, let me look inside<br />
Baby, we&#8217;ll go wrong if you try to hide<br />
So tell me who you&#8230; tell me who you are</p>
<p>You are here, still around me<br />
But your mind goes runnin&#8217; free, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>(Tell me who you are, show me what to do)<br />
Tell me who you are<br />
(Let me be the one that you hold on to)<br />
Let me be the one you hold on to</p>
<p>(Open up your heart, let me look inside)<br />
Open up your heart and let me look inside<br />
(Baby, we&#8217;ll go wrong if you try to hide)<br />
Baby, we&#8217;ll go wrong if you hide</p>
<p>Tell me who you are, show me what to do<br />
Let me be the one that you hold on to<br />
Open up your heart, let me look inside<br />
Baby, we&#8217;ll go wrong if you try to hide<br />
So tell me who you are</p>
