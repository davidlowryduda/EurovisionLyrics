A heart as big as the world<br />
A smile and a sparkle in the eyes<br />
And the word you know so well</p>
<p>In life there are many roads<br />
Don&#8217;t look for happiness where there is none<br />
Just listen to what your heart says</p>
<p>I can offer you only love<br />
One and only hope<br />
Just look me in the eyes, and you&#8217;re easily carefree<br />
I know you feel the same</p>
<p>What you want is not a sin<br />
That&#8217;s love in your eyes</p>
<p>You know me better than you think<br />
Even though you&#8217;re shutting your eyes<br />
When you look at me, you see what you are</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been searching for so long<br />
For what you tought was right<br />
But, but, but in the end, you&#8217;ll choose only one</p>
<p>I can offer you only love<br />
One and only hope<br />
Just look me in the eyes, and you&#8217;re easily carefree<br />
I know you feel the same</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; I can offer you only love<br />
One and only hope<br />
Just look me in the eyes, and you&#8217;re easily carefree<br />
(Just look me in the eyes, and you&#8217;re easily carefree)</p>
<p>I know you feel the same<br />
Oh&#8230; I know you feel the same<br />
