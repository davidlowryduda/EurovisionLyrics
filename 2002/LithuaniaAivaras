<p>Wanna show to you alone<br />
The world around us, high and low<br />
Glowing stars and dancing moon<br />
Happy I &#8217;cause happy you </p>
<p>Close your eyes and make a wish<br />
Could it be a scorching kiss?<br />
You&#8217;re my sweetest mountain dew (Baby)<br />
Happy I &#8217;cause happy you<br />
For our dreams come true, they always do </p>
<p>Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies<br />
Hoping this day will never end<br />
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme<br />
A song of love composed for you </p>
<p>Love brings passion, love brings joy<br />
Love brings riches we enjoy<br />
All is wonder, all is new (Baby)<br />
Happy I &#8217;cause happy you<br />
For our dreams come true, they always do </p>
<p>Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies<br />
Hoping this day will never end<br />
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme<br />
A song of love composed for you </p>
<p>(Watching the sunrise)<br />
Babe, it looks great<br />
(Singing a love song)<br />
Babe, it sounds great </p>
<p>Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies<br />
Hoping this day will never end<br />
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme<br />
A song of love composed for you </p>
<p>Watching the sunrise, beautiful red skies<br />
Hoping this day will never end<br />
Singing a love song with a perfect rhyme<br />
A song of love composed for you </p>
<p>Watching the sunrise </p>
