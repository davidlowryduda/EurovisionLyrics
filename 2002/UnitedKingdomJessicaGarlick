<p>We both made the same mistakes<br />
And believe me, I know it<br />
I&#8217;ve come to depend on you<br />
In my eyes, can you see<br />
That someone&#8217;s still hurting me?</p>
<p>What can I say<br />
That will make up for letting you down?<br />
I just want you to know</p>
<p>So come back (Come back)<br />
If you love me<br />
How will I survive without you<br />
(Without you)</p>
<p>Baby, come back (Come back)<br />
If you need me<br />
Maybe I was wrong<br />
And I tried to pretend, but</p>
<p>Always in my heart<br />
I know that I want you<br />
Come back&#8230;</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s another day, still I<br />
Can&#8217;t believe that I told you<br />
And that was my big mistake<br />
Every hour, every day<br />
What can I do to make it through?</p>
<p>Oh, the days seem so long<br />
I miss you so bad<br />
And it&#8217;s breaking my heart</p>
<p>So come back (Come back)<br />
If you love me (How will I survive)<br />
How will I survive without you?<br />
(Without you?)</p>
<p>Baby, come back (Come back)<br />
If you need me (How will I survive)<br />
How will I survive without you?<br />
(Without you, without you?)</p>
<p>Baby, come back (Come back)<br />
If you need me<br />
Maybe I was wrong<br />
And I tried to pretend, but</p>
<p>Always in my heart<br />
I know that I want you<br />
Come back (Come back)<br />
Before you break my heart</p>
<p>Oh, come back&#8230;</p>
