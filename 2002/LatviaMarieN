<p>I&#8217;d like to go away, but it&#8217;s easier to say<br />
That you know all the tricks that make, that make me stay<br />
I&#8217;m ready to support this artful game you always play<br />
&#8216;Cause you don&#8217;t know the fee that you will later, later pay</p>
<p>Today you think you are the winner<br />
Today you think you are the king<br />
You make me sweat in my emotions<br />
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing</p>
<p>I wanna be the sunshine in your arms<br />
I wanna be the light from shooting stars<br />
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies<br />
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes</p>
<p>I wanna be the sunshine in your arms<br />
I wanna be the light from shooting stars<br />
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies<br />
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes</p>
<p>Ay ay ay ay ay ay&#8230; </p>
<p>I like a simple game, but it&#8217;s just easier to say<br />
That you own all that rules your crazy, crazy way<br />
And even though you&#8217;ll go on doing whatever, whatever you may<br />
Just remember &#8211; it&#8217;s me who find you when, when you was stray</p>
<p>Today you think you are the winner<br />
Today you think you are the king<br />
You make me sweat in my emotions<br />
Under your fly-away, fly-away wing</p>
<p>I wanna be the sunshine in your arms<br />
I wanna be the light from shooting stars<br />
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies<br />
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes</p>
<p>I wanna be the sunshine in your arms<br />
I wanna be the light from shooting stars<br />
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies<br />
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes</p>
<p>I wanna be the sunshine in your arms<br />
I wanna be the light from shooting stars<br />
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies<br />
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes</p>
<p>I wanna be the sunshine in your arms<br />
I wanna be the light from shooting stars<br />
I wanna be the queen in your sweet lies<br />
I wanna be the love-spark in your eyes</p>
<p>Ay ay ay ay ay ay&#8230;</p>
