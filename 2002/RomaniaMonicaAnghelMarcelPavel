<p>We are behaving like two strangers in the gloomy night<br />
We have lost so many feelings in this endless fight<br />
If you want to go away, now I must obey<br />
But for my part, you&#8217;ll remain always in my heart</p>
<p>Tell me why we have to say goodbye<br />
Was our love only a foolish lie?<br />
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry?<br />
No more tears, no more fears<br />
Nothing more to share together</p>
<p>If you want to go away, now I must obey<br />
But for my part, you&#8217;ll remain always in my heart</p>
<p>Tell me why we have to say goodbye<br />
Why we broke our wings in flight<br />
Tell me why couldn&#8217;t we just try<br />
To forgive and believe we can reach the sky?</p>
<p>Tell me why we have to say goodbye<br />
Was our love only a foolish lie?<br />
Tell me why your eyes are cold and dry?<br />
No more tears, no more fears<br />
Nothing more to share together</p>
<p>Tell me why?</p>
