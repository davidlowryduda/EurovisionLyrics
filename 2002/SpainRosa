<p>I&#8217;m happy to be here today<br />
And don&#8217;t you ask me why again<br />
The emotion already runs through my veins<br />
And an illusion is born inside of me</p>
<p>I feel something new inside of me<br />
That leads me to you<br />
A path to be made (path to be made)<br />
With nothing to hide</p>
<p><em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
All of us, we&#8217;re going to sing<br />
<em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
Our dream &#8211; a reality</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll never hear the voices that stop us<br />
From making the last step<br />
If passion exists within us<br />
And a light shines inside of you</p>
<p>Now the times have changed<br />
And it will be forever<br />
Don&#8217;t hesitate, please<br />
Your heart says it</p>
<p><em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
All of us, we&#8217;re going to sing<br />
<em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
Our dream &#8211; a reality</p>
<p>Love, don&#8217;t leave us (Don&#8217;t do it, please)<br />
Don&#8217;t say goodbye (Never ever)<br />
And keep growing and growing<br />
The strength and the illusion</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
All of us, we&#8217;re going to sing<br />
<em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
Our dream &#8211; a reality</p>
<p><em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
New times &#8211; we need<br />
<em>Europe&#8217;s living a celebration</em><br />
It&#8217;s your party and there&#8217;s no going back</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
