The wind carries memories of a time<br />
That seems so far away<br />
But now it&#8217;s changed, now it has lost its shine</p>
<p>The falling snow reminds me of an old love<br />
That gives me the will to go on<br />
But the wheel of fortune will roll again, I know</p>
<p>Try to imagine, even for a moment<br />
A place, a piece of land in the south<br />
It could be paradise for you<br />
But that, you know, depends on us</p>
<p>Now we are all gathered at one same place in this time<br />
That seems so insecure<br />
But the wheel of fortune will spin again, I know<br />
Won&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Even for a moment<br />
A place, a piece of land in the south<br />
It could be paradise for you<br />
(But that) You know, depends on us</p>
<p>Try to imagine, ever for a moment<br />
A place, a piece of land in the south<br />
(It could be paradise for you)<br />
But that, you know, depends on us</p>
<p>Try to imagine, even for a moment<br />
A place, a piece of land in the south<br />
It could be paradise for you<br />
But that, you know, depends on us<br />
