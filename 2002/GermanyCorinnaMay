<p>You&#8217;re my song in the morning, you&#8217;re the rhythm of my heartbeat at night<br />
And the sound of love I hear in your voice keeps on touching me deep inside<br />
You are the air that I breathe and the gentle tune of whisperin&#8217; trees<br />
You&#8217;re the only melody that&#8217;s in my soul and in my mind all the time </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t live without music, only you keep me goin&#8217; along<br />
I can&#8217;t live without music and the power that&#8217;s deep in your song<br />
You&#8217;re the one and only thing I couldn&#8217;t do without<br />
Makes me wanna sing and dance and shout </p>
<p>We can&#8217;t live without music, we can&#8217;t live without music<br />
It&#8217;s a rainbow in the night, turns darkness into light<br />
It&#8217;s everything we really need </p>
<p>We can&#8217;t live without music, and if ever we lose it<br />
That&#8217;s when everybody, just everybody, starts getting the blues<br />
(We can&#8217;t live without music) &#8217;cause it&#8217;s freedom to me and to you </p>
<p>So let the music touch your heart in times when men are worlds apart<br />
&#8216;Cause only love can heal the dream that&#8217;s hidden in our souls<br />
And hand in hand we&#8217;ll walk along, we&#8217;ll be united by a peaceful song<br />
And we&#8217;ll live all together </p>
<p>(We can&#8217;t live without music, we can&#8217;t live without music)<br />
I can&#8217;t live without music, I can&#8217;t live without music<br />
And if anybody, just anybody, is asking me why<br />
Music makes me feel like flyin&#8217;, gives me hope when I&#8217;m a-cryin&#8217;<br />
I believe without it I would die </p>
