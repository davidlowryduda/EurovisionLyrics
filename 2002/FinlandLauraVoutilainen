<p>You don&#8217;t know how I was then<br />
All broken up, my pride was stolen<br />
I lived a little lie<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t show the hurting inside </p>
<p>I was livin&#8217; in emptiness, I was out of love<br />
Guard my heart, my wall was so high<br />
You came in with all your confidence<br />
You swept me away off the ground, you taught me to fly </p>
<p>Holding on until the next time, I can&#8217;t get you out of my mind<br />
If you were a drug, I&#8217;d be addicted to you<br />
Every time that we say &#8216;goodbye&#8217;, I just die a little inside<br />
How&#8217;d I fall so hard? &#8211; I&#8217;m so addicted to you </p>
<p>Addicted to you, addicted to you<br />
So addicted to you, I&#8217;m so addicted to you, oh&#8230; </p>
<p>Why couldn&#8217;t this be simple?<br />
We&#8217;d live just like the other people<br />
Now that you&#8217;re far away<br />
My missing is a constant heartache </p>
<p>&#8216;Cause those sparkles back in my eyes<br />
I wish I could stay just like this, don&#8217;t want you to go<br />
When you&#8217;re far away, fantasize<br />
That you&#8217;re in my arms and I jump when I hear the phone </p>
<p>Holding on until the next time, I can&#8217;t get you out of my mind<br />
If you were a drug, I&#8217;d be addicted to you<br />
Every time that we say &#8216;goodbye&#8217;, I just die a little inside<br />
How&#8217;d I fall so hard? &#8211; I&#8217;m so addicted to you </p>
<p>Addiction &#8211; it&#8217;s hitting hard<br />
Now it&#8217;s got its hold<br />
Oh&#8230; I can&#8217;t let go </p>
<p>(Holding on until the next time) I can&#8217;t get you out of my mind<br />
If you were a drug, I&#8217;d be addicted to you<br />
Every time that we say &#8216;goodbye&#8217;, I just die a little inside<br />
How&#8217;d I fall so hard? &#8211; I&#8217;m so addicted to you </p>
<p>Holding on until the next time, I can&#8217;t get you out of my mind<br />
If you were a drug, I&#8217;d be addicted to you </p>
