<p>Seven degrees, I&#8217;m down on my knees<br />
Waiting for the man to put me under his spell<br />
Seven o&#8217; five, he walks into sight<br />
Givin&#8217; me the eye, he lifts my spirits high</p>
<p>His passion burns and my luck takes a turn<br />
I&#8217;m reborn and alive with his love to survive</p>
<p>Is it good? Is it bad? Am I simply going mad?<br />
Is it fiction or fact? Am I really losing tact?<br />
Is he magical, logical, natural? I wonder<br />
He&#8217;s got the makings of my seventh wonder<br />
Ooh hoo&#8230; hoo&#8230; hoo&#8230;</p>
<p>Seventy three kisses for me<br />
That whisper through the silence his feelings for me<br />
Softly he dips my cherry-red lips<br />
In the essence of a hope on which my love can float</p>
<p>His passion burns and my luck takes a turn<br />
I&#8217;m reborn and alive with his love to survive</p>
<p>Is it good? Is it bad? Am I simply going mad?<br />
Is it fiction or fact? Am I really losing tact?<br />
Is he magical, logical, natural? I wonder<br />
He&#8217;s got the makings of my seventh wonder</p>
<p>On seven seas we sail on this dream<br />
Turning it into virtual reality, reality</p>
<p>Is it good? Is it bad? Am I simply going mad?<br />
Is it fiction or fact? Am I really losing tact?<br />
(Is he magical?) Magical (Logical, natural? I wonder)<br />
He&#8217;s got the makings of my seventh wonder</p>
<p>Am I weak? Am I strong? In his arms do I belong?<br />
I could climb mountain high, for his love I&#8217;d learn to fly<br />
Is he magical, logical, natural? I wonder<br />
He&#8217;s got the makings of my seventh wonder</p>
<p>(Is he fiction or a matter of fact?) Seventh wonder<br />
(Is he fiction or a matter of fact?) Seventh wonder</p>
