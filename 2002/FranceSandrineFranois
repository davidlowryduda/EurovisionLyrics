It takes time to learn how to smile<br />
To learn how to grow in the middle of a fight<br />
It takes time to learn how to love<br />
To lend your toys, but we&#8217;re not there yet</p>
<p>It takes time, that&#8217;s what they say to us, they say<br />
They talk and they write, and the war sells<br />
It takes time, but the deaf still talk<br />
When the dust falls asleep, I pray in the wind</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fought for that, I&#8217;ve clasped in my voice<br />
All those words that are frightening when we can&#8217;t hear them<br />
I&#8217;ve fought for that, I&#8217;ve clasped in my arms<br />
All those crying women that we can&#8217;t see</p>
<p>It takes time to hang without much ado<br />
The ideals that are too short and make blood splatter<br />
It takes time, no, it takes a strong will<br />
Mr Ghandi has died, will he be dead for a long time?</p>
<p>I would fight for that, here and now<br />
I don&#8217;t have the time, I only have one life in front of me<br />
I will fight for that, how will I fight<br />
Peace is only a child that doesn&#8217;t walk straight</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only a little soldier with no weapon but my voice<br />
But I&#8217;ll cry for you, my dove for you<br />
I&#8217;m only a little soldier, now and over there<br />
But a thousand voices will shout it with me</p>
<p>I will fight for that, here and now<br />
I hear the wind rising, but who will get up?<br />
I will fight for that, how will I fight<br />
They say that it takes time, but a thousand voices<br />
Will shout it with me<br />
