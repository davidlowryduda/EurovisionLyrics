<p>Did somebody dare to tell you what&#8217;s right<br />
Which colours to wear, to laugh or cry?<br />
You wanna be fair, and maybe you&#8217;re right<br />
Let&#8217;s burn our fingers, stop the fight</p>
<p>Always drivin&#8217; through red lights, babe<br />
Everybody stops but me</p>
<p>Just run away to the stars<br />
Just run away till you&#8217;re high enough<br />
I will be waitin&#8217; above<br />
I&#8217;ll make it happen, I try so hard</p>
<p>How lucky you are, your statement is fine<br />
Because what you think is what you find<br />
(What you think is what you find)</p>
<p>Always drivin&#8217; through red lights, babe<br />
Everybody stops but me</p>
<p>Just run away to the stars<br />
Just run away till you&#8217;re high enough<br />
I will be waitin&#8217; above<br />
I&#8217;ll make it happen, I try so hard</p>
<p>Just run away to the stars<br />
Just run away till you&#8217;re high enough<br />
I will be waitin&#8217; above<br />
I&#8217;ll make it happen, I try so hard</p>
<p>Did somebody say it&#8217;s gonna be easy<br />
Till you get to where you do belong?<br />
Your newly opened mind explains the reasons<br />
Why you have to carry on</p>
<p>Just run away to the&#8230;<br />
Just run away to the stars<br />
Just run away till you&#8217;re high enough<br />
I will be waitin&#8217; above<br />
I&#8217;ll make it happen, I try so hard</p>
<p>Just run away to the stars<br />
Just run away till you&#8217;re high enough<br />
I will be waitin&#8217; above<br />
I&#8217;ll make it happen, I try so hard</p>
<p>Oh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Just run away to the stars</p>
