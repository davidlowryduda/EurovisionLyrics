<p>Since you came into my life I&#8217;ve been touched by happiness<br />
I feel love is all around &#8217;cause there is no more loneliness<br />
And there&#8217;s one thing that is true<br />
You should know how much I love you</p>
<p>Love is everything I want, love is everything I need<br />
Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny<br />
Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me<br />
Let me show you what I feel because my love is real</p>
<p>The girl I was I left behind, incomplete and insecure<br />
Now I got you on my mind and I feel like I&#8217;ve been cured<br />
And there&#8217;s one thing that is true<br />
You should know how much I love you</p>
<p>Love is everything I want, love is everything I need<br />
Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny<br />
Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me<br />
Let me show you what I feel because my love is real</p>
<p>(Ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230;) Whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>(Love is everything I want, love is everything I need)<br />
(Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny)<br />
Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me<br />
Let me show you what I feel because my love is real</p>
<p>(Love is everything I want, love is everything I need)<br />
(Thinking of the day we met as sign of destiny) Thinking of the day<br />
(Love is everything I want, I believe in you and me)<br />
(Let me show you what I feel) because my love is real<br />
Because my love is real</p>
