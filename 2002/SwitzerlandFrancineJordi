I dream of a summer house that only belongs to us<br />
Of an island on which the dream goes on until the end<br />
Of a small Garden of Eden, cradle of our love<br />
That realizes this dream by offering its treasures</p>
<p>In the garden of my soul your heart is covered in flowers<br />
In the garden of my soul you will find your home<br />
The most beautiful rose delighted me a thousand times<br />
In the garden of my soul there&#8217;s only you for me</p>
<p>Come into my summer house, come and find me<br />
Love lends you its wings, you will arrive there<br />
The fortune that finds us followed us from afar<br />
Nothing can separate us, we are its witnesses</p>
<p>In the garden of my soul your heart is covered in flowers<br />
In the garden of my soul you will find your home<br />
The most beautiful rose delighted me a thousand times<br />
In the garden of my soul there&#8217;s only you for me</p>
<p>In the garden of my soul your heart is covered in flowers<br />
In the garden of my soul you will find your home<br />
The most beautiful rose delighted me a thousand times<br />
In the garden of my soul there&#8217;s only you for me<br />
