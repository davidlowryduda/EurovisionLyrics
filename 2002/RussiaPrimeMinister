<p>In all my wanderings around the world<br />
I met so many kinds of pretty girls<br />
All of them like precious stones<br />
Sparkling on their own</p>
<p>I found them fiery, tender, bright and sweet<br />
In Rome and Paris, Lisbon and Madrid<br />
But one girl remains for me<br />
Still a real mystery<br />
I&#8217;ve been thinkin&#8217; about you</p>
<p>Northern girl, Lady Ice &#8211; how can I melt you, baby?<br />
Northern girl, never cries &#8211; tough like a pearl<br />
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby<br />
Northern girl</p>
<p>We drink the sunset like ruby wine<br />
But still you keep your head and hold the line<br />
Even when you look aside<br />
I admire your pride</p>
<p>We stand together closely, skin to skin<br />
You look forbidding as the Snow Queen<br />
But I hear your secret call<br />
&#8216;Cause your fortress has no walls<br />
I&#8217;m still thinkin&#8217; about you</p>
<p>Northern girl, Lady Ice &#8211; how can I melt you, baby?<br />
Northern girl, never cries &#8211; tough like a pearl<br />
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby<br />
Northern girl</p>
<p>Northern girl, Lady Ice &#8211; how can I melt you, baby?<br />
Northern girl, never cries &#8211; tough like a pearl<br />
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby<br />
Northern girl</p>
<p>And when you ask me tonight<br />
Why I search for love so, so far<br />
I will hold you and whisper<br />
You&#8217;re my Northern Star, guiding star, baby</p>
<p>Northern girl, Lady Ice &#8211; how can I melt you, baby?<br />
Northern girl, never cries &#8211; tough like a pearl<br />
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby<br />
Northern girl</p>
<p>Northern girl, Lady Ice &#8211; how can I melt you, baby? (You&#8217;re my northern girl)<br />
Northern girl, never cries &#8211; tough like a pearl (You&#8217;re my guiding star)<br />
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby (Northern girl)<br />
Northern girl</p>
<p>Northern girl</p>
