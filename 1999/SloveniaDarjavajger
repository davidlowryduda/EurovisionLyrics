<p>Teardrops in my eyes, a dance of glistening rain<br />
Falling from the sky, a carpet of the stars<br />
Clouds of tenderness are fleeing in the light<br />
Now it&#8217;s here, the light for a thousand years</p>
<p>I tremble in your eyes, I tremble in your palms<br />
Lie inside you deep, in dreams of yours I sleep<br />
Caress you with my eyes and love you with my hands<br />
Yes, I feel the light for a thousand years</p>
<p>I know you are my love<br />
A touch, a kiss, your heart is mine<br />
I know the light is always here<br />
We kiss each other in its shine</p>
<p>I tremble in your eyes, I tremble in your palms<br />
Lie inside you deep, in dreams of yours I sleep<br />
Caress you with my eyes and love you with my hands<br />
Yes, I feel the light for a thousand years</p>
<p>I know you are my love<br />
A touch, a kiss, your heart is mine<br />
I know the light is always here<br />
We kiss each other in its shine</p>
