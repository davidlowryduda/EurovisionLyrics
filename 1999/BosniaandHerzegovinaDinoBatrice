I believe in God and God&#8217;s decree<br />
And I believe that nothing is an illusion<br />
Everything is so true, so real<br />
I believe in it, I believe in it</p>
<p>No, nothing occurred that didn&#8217;t have to<br />
There isn&#8217;t a face that wasn&#8217;t wrinkled<br />
There isn&#8217;t a rock that won&#8217;t become ashes<br />
No shoulder that won&#8217;t feel fear</p>
<p>What is it that you want?<br />
You are the traveller</p>
<p>We are, you are, they are, they are<br />
We are, you are the travellers<br />
We have, you have, they have, they have<br />
We have, you have the house, the house</p>
<p>Arrival is a dream, cover of a book<br />
But parting is a dream&#8217;s evil sister<br />
What are we, if not travellers without a place?<br />
We&#8217;ll never know where this road leads us</p>
<p>What are we<br />
What are we, you and me<br />
If not travellers without a place?</p>
<p>Tell me are you sorry, do you feel remorse<br />
If you say yes, you&#8217;ll be giving up on yourself<br />
Tell me are you sorry, do you feel remorse<br />
If you say yes, it&#8217;ll be a proof of choice</p>
<p>What is it that you want?<br />
You are the traveller</p>
<p>We are, you are, they are, they are<br />
We are, you are the travellers<br />
We have, you have, they have, they have<br />
We have, you have the house, the house</p>
<p>We are, you are, they are, they are<br />
We are, you are the travellers<br />
We have, you have, they have, they have<br />
We have, you have the house, the house<br />
