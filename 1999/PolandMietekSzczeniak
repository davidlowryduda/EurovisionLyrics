Hoo&#8230; hoo yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know who wrote the text of our roles<br />
I don&#8217;t know why there&#8217;s error, pain and remorse</p>
<p>Show me the way to simple words through every day<br />
Show me the way when shadows fall and lights fade</p>
<p>Hold me tight and turn the ice into snowflakes<br />
Hold me tight, give me a well of spring waters</p>
<p>Till remorse can mend errors, I cherish hope<br />
Till a tear is still a tear, I&#8217;m not alone<br />
No, I&#8217;m not alone&#8230;</p>
<p>As long as a tear is still a tear, I&#8217;m not alone<br />
Oh no, I&#8217;m not alone<br />
