If there are no more borders from our lives to our dreams<br />
And more than one banner, a smile on our lips<br />
If the walls which separated our souls, have fallen<br />
If it&#8217;s enough to exist to get the flame burning<br />
If it&#8217;s enough to sing, if it&#8217;s enough to sing</p>
<p>I want to give my voice, I want to give my words<br />
I want to give my faith and my life as a present<br />
I want to give my heart, all love yet to come<br />
Invent a happiness and never die</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s no more war which is won in advance<br />
If there are no more barriers, no more differences<br />
If there are no more chains which can&#8217;t be destroyed<br />
If there&#8217;s no more hatred to hide a smile<br />
If it&#8217;s enough to sing, if it&#8217;s enough to sing</p>
<p>I want to give my voice, I want to give my words<br />
I want to give my faith and my life as a present<br />
I want to give my heart, all love yet to come<br />
Invent a happiness and never die<br />
Never die</p>
<p>I want to give my voice, I want to give my words<br />
I want to give my faith and my life as a present<br />
I want to give my heart, all love yet to come<br />
Invent a happiness and never die</p>
<p>Giving&#8230; by dying&#8230;<br />
I want to give&#8230; I want to give my voice<br />
