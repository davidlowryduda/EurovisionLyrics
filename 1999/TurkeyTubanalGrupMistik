Ah&#8230; the first wintry wind has blown on me, I was beside myself<br />
Ah&#8230; I&#8217;ve got things with me, but where are you? I&#8217;m lost<br />
Ah&#8230; my loneliness is burning me down, like it&#8217;s hard<br />
Ah&#8230; my heart hurts from the past, don&#8217;t you ever cry</p>
<p>Take me, embrace me, do what you wanna do with me<br />
There&#8217;s no end, there&#8217;s no tomorrow, in the whirlwind of love<br />
I kill myself, I lose myself<br />
Look how I despair</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t we laugh together?<br />
Didn&#8217;t we love together?<br />
Didn&#8217;t we promise together?<br />
Run back, come back</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t we laugh together?<br />
Didn&#8217;t we love together ?<br />
Didn&#8217;t we do enough for our love?<br />
Run back, come back, run</p>
