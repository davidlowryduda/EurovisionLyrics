Hi, hi, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>hand in hand on the journey to Jerusalem</em></font></p>
<p>Hi, hi, let&#8217;s go on the journey to Jerusalem<br />
Hi, hi, come on, let&#8217;s go to Jerusalem all together</p>
<p>Already when I was a child, we played this game<br />
Musical chairs, only one reaches the goal<br />
Then when the rhythm suddenly stops<br />
It means, it is over, there is no more free space</p>
<p>Hi, hi, let&#8217;s go on the journey to Jerusalem<br />
Hi, hi, come on, let&#8217;s go to Jerusalem all together</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got a dream, that never loses its power<br />
Life is a journey, that leads to tomorrow<br />
Peace is more than just a game, where only one can win<br />
Because we&#8217;re human</p>
<p>Hi, hi, let&#8217;s go on the journey to Jerusalem<br />
Hi, hi, come on, let&#8217;s go to Jerusalem all together</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We walk hand in hand to a peaceful land</em></font><br />
I wish there was peace and everybody would be hand in hand<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We walk hand in hand to a peaceful land</em></font><br />
There would be friendship and no quarrels<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And if we stay friends, a dream will live forever</em></font></p>
<p>And all this will happen in the future<br />
Some day we&#8217;ll arrive</p>
<p>Hi, hi, let&#8217;s go on the journey to Jerusalem<br />
Hi, hi, come on let&#8217;s go to Jerusalem, all together<br />
Hi, hi, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>here we go again on the journey to Jerusalem</em></font><br />
Hi, hi, come on let&#8217;s go to Jerusalem, all together</p>
<p>Hi, hi, hand in hand on the journey to Jerusalem<br />
Hi, hi, let&#8217;s go on the journey to Jerusalem<br />
