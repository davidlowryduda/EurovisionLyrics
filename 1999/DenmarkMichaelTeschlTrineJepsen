<p>(This time I mean it, oh baby)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s all about<br />
But I&#8217;m startin&#8217; to figure out<br />
Simple songs on the radio<br />
Kinda colour the way I go</p>
<p>Every song holds an inner key<br />
To my dreams and my fantasy<br />
Defences down and suddenly<br />
All your love comes back to me</p>
<p>And this time I mean it, oh baby<br />
This time I mean it and now<br />
You got me goin&#8217; so crazy<br />
Even though I don&#8217;t know how</p>
<p>Tried it before but we never happened<br />
We just gotta try it again<br />
Well, this time I mean it, oh baby<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you again</p>
<p>Oh, I know what was said and done<br />
It&#8217;s been hard just to carry on<br />
The sweetest love left a bitter taste<br />
Who&#8217;s to say it was all a waste?</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; &#8217;cause in each quarrel, in every fight<br />
There&#8217;s a lesson &#8217;bout wrong and right<br />
Oh, looking back, I&#8217;m sure to say<br />
That we learned from yesterday</p>
<p>So this time I mean it, oh baby<br />
This time I mean it and now<br />
You got me goin&#8217; so crazy<br />
Even though I don&#8217;t know how</p>
<p>We tried it before but we never happened<br />
We just gotta try it again<br />
Well, this time I mean it, oh baby<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you again</p>
<p>This time I mean it, oh baby<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you again</p>
