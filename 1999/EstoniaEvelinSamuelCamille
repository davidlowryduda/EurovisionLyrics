<p>Silently glowing, moonbeams are sowing<br />
Silver, silver starry-eyed skies<br />
Burning in fire, words of desire<br />
Linger, linger, long in disguise</p>
<p>Diamond of night, burning so bright<br />
Guide me my silvery new sign<br />
Finding my way as I pray<br />
Now I can say it is my time</p>
<p>Voices are calling, whilst stardust falling<br />
Reveries, reveries lighten his heart<br />
Silently blazing, stars so amazing<br />
Heavenly, heavenly fire from a spark</p>
<p>Diamond of night, burning so bright<br />
Guide me my silvery new sign<br />
Finding my way as I pray<br />
Now I can say it is my time</p>
<p>Diamond of night, burning so bright<br />
Guide me my silvery new sign<br />
Finding my way as I pray<br />
Now I can say it is my time</p>
<p>Diamond of night, burning bright<br />
Now I can say it is my time</p>
