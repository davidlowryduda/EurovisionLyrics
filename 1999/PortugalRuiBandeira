Who is going to tell me how it all began?<br />
My life makes no sense now<br />
I know there won&#8217;t be any way of seeing you<br />
I don&#8217;t know for what reason you left</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to harm you, I never knew how to see<br />
What you imagined for yourself</p>
<p>Give me your hand, don&#8217;t lie<br />
Remember your eyes are crystals<br />
Please, don&#8217;t tell me you won&#8217;t leave<br />
Because I always know where you go</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason anymore, to live without the passion<br />
That torments me and chases me every hour</p>
<p>So without wanting it, I caused harm, I never knew how to see<br />
What you imagined for yourself</p>
<p>Give me your hand, don&#8217;t lie<br />
Remember your eyes are crystals<br />
Please don&#8217;t tell me you won&#8217;t leave<br />
Because I always know where you go</p>
<p>Give me your hand, don&#8217;t lie<br />
Remember your eyes are crystals<br />
Give me your hand<br />
