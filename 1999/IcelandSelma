<p>Don&#8217;t work on a Sunday, don&#8217;t sleep on a Monday<br />
Just think of a fun day when your life is getting you down, yeah<br />
To get through a heartache, just picture a spring day<br />
And play in the bright daylight a while<br />
So give it a chance, you won&#8217;t regret it</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you know today won&#8217;t last forever<br />
Tomorrow has a brand new name<br />
I&#8217;ll give you all that I can offer<br />
The rest is all up to you, yeah</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all out of luck, if you wanna give up<br />
You&#8217;ve got to let go of all your bad memories<br />
Breakin&#8217; it up means bringing it down<br />
You need to get right back on track</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re all out of luck, if you wanna give up<br />
You&#8217;ve got to believe in yourself<br />
You&#8217;ll be fine &#8217;cause you&#8217;ll be mine<br />
So just wake up before it&#8217;s too late<br />
And you&#8217;re all out of love, you&#8217;re all out of love</p>
<p>Hey yeah&#8230; hey yeah&#8230; oh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t work on a Sunday, don&#8217;t sleep on a Monday<br />
Tomorrow&#8217;s a new day, all the time, just waiting for you, yeah<br />
From dawn until midnight, or asleep in the moonlight<br />
You&#8217;ll always be all right just as long as you follow your heart, yeah</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all out of luck, if you wanna give up<br />
You&#8217;ve got to let go of all your bad memories<br />
Breakin&#8217; it up means bringing it down<br />
You need to get right back on track</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re all out of luck, if you wanna give up<br />
You&#8217;ve got to believe in yourself<br />
You&#8217;ll be fine &#8217;cause you&#8217;ll be mine<br />
So just wake up before it&#8217;s too late<br />
And you&#8217;re all out of love, you&#8217;re all out of love</p>
<p>(Hey yeah&#8230; hey yeah&#8230; oh yeah&#8230;)<br />
You&#8217;re all out of love<br />
Hey yeah&#8230; hey yeah&#8230; oh yeah&#8230;</p>
