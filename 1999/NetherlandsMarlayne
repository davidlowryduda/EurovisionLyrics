<p>You know there never was a doubt in my mind<br />
You only have to follow and learn how to read the signs<br />
A heartache always seems so easy to find<br />
But I will never let go, I wanna see what this love has to hide</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll just have to face it, rearrange and place it<br />
I&#8217;ll never let love pass us by</p>
<p>Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
Say: &#8220;I love you forever&#8221;, say you will, say you do<br />
Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
Say: &#8220;I love you forever&#8221;, say you will, say: &#8220;I do&#8221;</p>
<p>You know there never was a cloud in my eye<br />
All we have is one chance to reach out for the clear blue skies<br />
We&#8217;ll just have to face it, rearrange and place it<br />
I&#8217;ll never let love pass us by</p>
<p>Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
Say: &#8220;I love you forever&#8221;, say you will, say you do<br />
Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
Say: &#8220;I love you forever&#8221;, say you will, say: &#8220;I do&#8221;</p>
<p>(And then the heart&#8230;)<br />
The heart gets stronger with every step that we take<br />
(From the moment&#8230;)<br />
From the moment we go to sleep till the time that we awake</p>
<p>(I won&#8217;t let&#8230;)<br />
I won&#8217;t let anybody lead us astray<br />
(And then the line&#8230;)<br />
And then the line from me to you will never break or fade away</p>
<p>Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
I love you forever, yes, I will, baby, I do</p>
<p>Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
Say: &#8220;I love you forever&#8221;, say you will, say you do<br />
Give me one good reason and I will give you two<br />
Say: &#8220;I love you forever&#8221;, say you will, say: &#8220;I do&#8221;</p>
<p>Say: &#8220;I do&#8221;</p>
