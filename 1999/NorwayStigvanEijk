<p>Living my life without you &#8211; can it be true?<br />
Something is missing, baby</p>
<p>Ah yeah&#8230; (Oh baby, I know it&#8217;s you)</p>
<p>Nothing feels the same without your loving<br />
I can&#8217;t stop the rain or wind from blowing<br />
I search inside my soul, try to recover<br />
But life is not the same without my lover</p>
<p>(Since you went away) can&#8217;t sleep<br />
(Since you went away) can&#8217;t eat<br />
My world is falling apart, oh baby, baby</p>
<p>Living my life without you &#8211; can it be true?<br />
Something is missing, baby<br />
Living my life without you &#8211; what can I do?<br />
I think I&#8217;m going crazy, (It&#8217;s you)</p>
<p>(Hey hey&#8230; I think I&#8217;m going crazy, baby)<br />
(Hey hey&#8230;) Ah&#8230;</p>
<p>Tried a new romance, tried to run away<br />
But nothing really makes sense when you&#8217;re gone, baby<br />
I never knew how much I needed you, girl<br />
What can I do to get you back in my world?</p>
<p>(Since you went away) can&#8217;t sleep<br />
(Since you went away) can&#8217;t eat<br />
My world is falling apart</p>
<p>Living my life without you &#8211; can it be true?<br />
Something is missing, baby<br />
Living my life without you &#8211; what can I do?<br />
I think I&#8217;m going crazy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s you (Oh baby, I know it&#8217;s you)<br />
I think I&#8217;m going crazy<br />
(Oh babe, what more can I do?) It&#8217;s you</p>
<p>(Hey hey&#8230; I think I&#8217;m going crazy, baby)<br />
(Hey hey&#8230;) Living my life without you</p>
<p>(Living my life without you &#8211; can it be true?)<br />
Something is missing, baby<br />
Baby&#8230; (Living my life without you &#8211; what) can I do?<br />
I think I&#8217;m going crazy</p>
<p>(Living my life without you &#8211; can it be true?)<br />
Something is missing, baby<br />
(Living my life without you &#8211; what can I do?)<br />
(I think I&#8217;m going crazy) I think I&#8217;m going crazy<br />
It&#8217;s you</p>
