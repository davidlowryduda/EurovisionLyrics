<p>Say it again&#8230;</p>
<p>I know I heard you right<br />
I&#8217;ve been a-lyin&#8217; awake at night<br />
Thinkin&#8217; about three words you said to me&#8230;</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s hard for you<br />
Sometimes you gotta let the feeling through<br />
I wanna know exactly how you feel<br />
Ooh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to be patient<br />
And give you a little more time<br />
Now I need to be sure<br />
What&#8217;s on your mind</p>
<p>Say it again (Say it)<br />
Say the words I heard you whisper<br />
Say it again (Say it)<br />
When last night we were together</p>
<p>Lyin&#8217; next to me, you said to me<br />
(Say it) Say it again</p>
<p>I knew right from the start<br />
You were livin&#8217; with a broken heart<br />
But baby, I knew, could take some time to heal&#8230;</p>
<p>But now I must confess<br />
The way you&#8217;re fillin&#8217; me with happiness<br />
Think that we could be startin&#8217; somethin&#8217; real<br />
Ooh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to be patient<br />
And give you a little more time<br />
Now I need to be sure<br />
What&#8217;s on your mind</p>
<p>Say it again (Say it)<br />
Say the words I heard you whisper<br />
Say it again (Say it)<br />
When last night we were together</p>
<p>Lyin&#8217; next to me, you said to me<br />
(Say it) Say it again</p>
<p>And I just need to be sure that you&#8217;re mine forever<br />
All I&#8217;m asking you for is to tell me whether<br />
I should be trustin&#8217; in you<br />
Tell me if the words you whispered were true<br />
Woah&#8230; (Say it, say it, say it, say it&#8230;)</p>
<p>Say it again (Say it)<br />
Say the words I heard you whisper<br />
Say it again (Say it)<br />
When last night we were together</p>
<p>Lyin&#8217; next to me, you said to me<br />
(Say it)</p>
<p>Say it again (Say it)<br />
Say the words I heard you whisper<br />
Say it again (Say it)<br />
When last night we were together</p>
<p>Lyin&#8217; next to me, you said to me<br />
(Say it) say it again</p>
