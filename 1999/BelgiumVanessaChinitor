<p>The wind has blown for eternity<br />
Never looking back, never giving in – never<br />
Causing the waves on the stormy sea<br />
But never staying long, always running on – always</p>
<p>Running on endlessly, and I know that I have to be<br />
Like the wind, be like the wind<br />
Like the wind: run forever free</p>
<p>The mountains, full of serenity<br />
Uncaring &#8217;bout the wind, never giving in – never<br />
But waves that roll on the stormy sea<br />
Turn mountains into dust, the wind, it wins at last – always</p>
<p>Running on endlessly, and I know that I have to be<br />
Like the wind, be like the wind<br />
Like the wind: run forever free</p>
<p>Running on endlessly, and I know that I have to be<br />
Like the wind (The wind has blown for eternity)<br />
Be like the wind (The wind has blown for eternity)<br />
Like the wind (The wind has blown for eternity)<br />
Run forever free</p>
