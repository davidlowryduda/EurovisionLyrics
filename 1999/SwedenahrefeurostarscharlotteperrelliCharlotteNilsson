<p>Shadows dancin&#8217; slowly on my wall<br />
Moonlight paintin&#8217; silver to the sound of heartbeats<br />
Magical emotions take control<br />
Knowin&#8217; we will meet before the night is over<br />
Then I&#8217;m gonna make you mine, love you till the end of time</p>
<p>Take me to your heaven, hold on to a dream<br />
Take me to your heaven when my nights are cold and lonely<br />
Flyin&#8217; high together on a journey to the stars<br />
Won&#8217;t you take me to your heaven, to your heart?</p>
<p>I can feel your body next to mine<br />
Reachin&#8217; for a kiss that keeps me warm and tender<br />
Seven steps to heaven show the way<br />
When I&#8217;m there, I give myself in sweet surrender<br />
Then I&#8217;m gonna make you mine, love you till the end of time</p>
<p>Take me to your heaven, hold on to a dream<br />
Take me to your heaven when my nights are cold and lonely<br />
Flyin&#8217; high together on a journey to the stars<br />
Won&#8217;t you take me to your heaven, to your heart?</p>
<p>As dawn is breakin&#8217; there is so much more to say<br />
So will you be my one and only when nights are lonely?<br />
Hold on tight forever</p>
<p>Take me to your heaven, hold on to a dream<br />
Take me to your heaven when my nights are cold and lonely<br />
Flyin&#8217; high together on a journey to the stars<br />
Won&#8217;t you take me to your heaven, to your heart?<br />
Oh&#8230; so won&#8217;t you take me to your heaven, to your heart?</p>
