<p>And you would always be there<br />
In everything I&#8217;d do<br />
But the fool that I am<br />
Never tried to understand</p>
<p>When you needed someone<br />
To help you through the rain<br />
But this child inside of me<br />
Never let me feel your pain</p>
<p>And how I&#8217;ve let it all just slip away<br />
And now I&#8217;m wishing for yesterday</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you go on your own<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me here alone<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ll be there, yes, I swear<br />
When you need me I&#8217;ll be there<br />
Don&#8217;t you go, I&#8217;m on my own, don&#8217;t you go</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been my inspiration<br />
All along the way<br />
But I can see it in your eyes<br />
Well, there&#8217;s no more yesterday</p>
<p>But I will find my way back<br />
No matter what it takes<br />
For the first time I can see<br />
The love you lost on me</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you go on your own<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me here alone<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ll be there, yes, I swear<br />
When you need me I&#8217;ll be there<br />
Don&#8217;t you go, no, no</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;ve let it all just slip away<br />
But the fool, the fool&#8217;s inside of me</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you go on your own<br />
Don&#8217;t leave me here alone<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;ll be there, yes, I swear<br />
When you need me I&#8217;ll be there<br />
Don&#8217;t you go, I&#8217;m on my own, don&#8217;t you go</p>
