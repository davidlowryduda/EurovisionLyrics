The moon lights dimly in the city<br />
And if you can bear with the scene<br />
Your eyes have taken two drops<br />
From the morning rain</p>
<p>Take the stars of the sky<br />
Embellish his glance<br />
Touch the flower of the lotus<br />
Call his name, and it will be love</p>
<p>Some star lights dimly in the city<br />
And you remained to live, yes, to live<br />
To the first of your heart&#8217;s summer<br />
Into the hugs of Sunday</p>
<p>Take the stars of the sky<br />
Embellish his glance<br />
Touch the flower of the lotus<br />
Call his name</p>
<p>(But don&#8217;t ask) It will be love<br />
But don&#8217;t ask, it will be love</p>
<p>(Take the stars of the sky)<br />
Embellish his glance<br />
Touch the flower of the lotus<br />
Call his name, and it will be love<br />
It will be love</p>
<p>(It will be love, it will be love, it will be love)<br />
