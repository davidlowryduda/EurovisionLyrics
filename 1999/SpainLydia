You&#8217;ve been hiding the truth for a long time<br />
Your plain naivety betrays you when you speak<br />
Who are you trying to fool?</p>
<p>I saw two shadows going out of a door<br />
I followed the steps as an accomplice of the darkness<br />
Hard reality, oh yeah<br />
I felt like dying when I saw her embracing you</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t want to listen<br />
To your voice whispering that you have loved me<br />
I know what the truth is<br />
I trusted in you and you&#8217;ve lied to me</p>
<p>Now you say that it was a confusion<br />
Only jealousy, the consequence of my imagination<br />
Broke my life in two, oh yeah<br />
I felt like dying when I saw her embracing you</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t want to listen<br />
To your voice whispering that you have loved me<br />
I know what the truth is<br />
I trusted in you and you&#8217;ve lied to me</p>
<p>(No) No, (I don&#8217;t want to listen) I don&#8217;t want to listen<br />
(To your voice whispering) Whispering (that you have loved me)<br />
I know what the truth is<br />
I trusted in you and you&#8217;ve lied to me</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to listen<br />
