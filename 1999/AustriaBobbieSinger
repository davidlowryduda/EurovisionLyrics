<p>When I&#8217;m sad, I need a shoulder to cry on<br />
When I&#8217;m bad, you know that I am better<br />
When you&#8217;re gone, you&#8217;re the one that I&#8217;m thinking of<br />
When I come, it&#8217;s to you that I run</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no need to be lonely<br />
I&#8217;ll be there everytime for you<br />
Isn&#8217;t that the way it&#8217;s supposed to be?<br />
Well, sometimes memories will have to do</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t you recognise me?<br />
Oh, I&#8217;m the one that you have seen<br />
The reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes</p>
<p>They say it&#8217;s a long way to heaven<br />
But they&#8217;re wrong, &#8217;cause heaven is you<br />
If I fall from grace everlasting<br />
There you are to make everything new</p>
<p>We can fly forever<br />
Wrap yourself around my emotions<br />
It&#8217;s only getting better and better<br />
Don&#8217;t ever think to doubt my devotion</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t you recognise me?<br />
Oh, I&#8217;m the one that you have seen<br />
The reflection in your eyes</p>
<p>The reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t you recognise me?<br />
Oh, I&#8217;m the one that you have seen<br />
The reflection in your eyes</p>
<p>The reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes<br />
The reflection in your eyes<br />
Reflection in your eyes</p>
<p>The reflection in your eyes</p>
