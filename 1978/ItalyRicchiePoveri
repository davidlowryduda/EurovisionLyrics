This love, I like you till death<br />
This love, come on, let&#8217;s stop dancing<br />
This love, it&#8217;s warm here, let&#8217;s go outside a while</p>
<p>This love, I&#8217;m not working tomorrow<br />
Neither do I, your mouth on mine<br />
It&#8217;s so hard to go away, it started like this<br />
Like this with nothing</p>
<p>The merry-go-round is turning, and my head is dizzy<br />
Tell the whole truth, and don&#8217;t be scared, no<br />
I bet you really want me<br />
Let&#8217;s go together, a little more, a little higher</p>
<p>This love, I like you till death<br />
Don&#8217;t speak, I can&#8217;t breathe<br />
This love, water splashes on me<br />
It&#8217;s true, I really want you</p>
<p>This love, your nails, my arms<br />
Your face, your mouth on mine<br />
It&#8217;s so hard to go away, there&#8217;s no reason to go away</p>
<p>This love, so many improvised games<br />
Two children would never have been<br />
More close, more impossible than us<br />
