I will never let myself be trained by the men, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve sworn<br />
Whatever they say, it doesn&#8217;t turn me on, I let them wait<br />
But once somebody came along telling me:<br />
&#8220;Do you want to live as a touch-me-not?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you never think about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fire (Fire) doesn&#8217;t just burn in the fireplace<br />
Fire (Fire) also burns inside of me<br />
And it&#8217;s getting hotter and hotter through your love</p>
<p>Fire (Fire) that no one can escape from<br />
Fire (Fire) gives meaning to life<br />
Don&#8217;t run away when you feel it&#8217;s here<br />
You&#8217;re in no danger at all</p>
<p>When I will burn my fingers today I won&#8217;t be sorry about it at all<br />
Is fire dangerous? I will think about it, once, when it suits me<br />
I want to experience it today, it&#8217;s strange<br />
Tomorrow I won&#8217;t be the same<br />
And that&#8217;s what you make clear to me</p>
<p>Fire (Fire) doesn&#8217;t just burn in the fireplace<br />
Fire (Fire) also burns inside of me<br />
And it&#8217;s getting hotter and hotter through your love</p>
<p>Fire (Fire) that no one can escape from<br />
Fire (Fire) gives meaning to life<br />
Don&#8217;t run away when you feel it&#8217;s here<br />
You&#8217;re in no danger at all</p>
<p>Fire (Fire) that no one can escape from<br />
Fire (Fire) gives meaning to life<br />
Don&#8217;t run away when you feel it&#8217;s here<br />
You&#8217;re in no danger at all<br />
(Fire, fire, fire, fire)<br />
