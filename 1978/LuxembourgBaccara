&#8211; Wow, hello, my dear, you&#8217;re looking great, Mayte<br />
How was it: the island, the sea, the beach?<br />
&#8211; Hmm&#8230; formidable, Maria, like a dream, ah, if you had seen it<br />
&#8211; Aha, did you understand the importance of knowing French? Tell me<br />
&#8211; No<br />
&#8211; I beg you, you see?<br />
&#8211; Oh, I know that, I mean&#8230;<br />
&#8211; Ah, I see: love? Ah, a love affair?<br />
&#8211; Go on…<br />
 &#8211; Well, that&#8217;s it</p>
<p>For hours on the beach, a beautiful afternoon<br />
The sun (The sun?) Wakes me up (Wakes you up?)<br />
What a young man walking by</p>
<p>A face, no wedding ring? His blue, very dangerous eyes<br />
And then? (Mmm then?) Ooh, that man (Ooh, that man?)<br />
Ooh, he comes to me like a bandit, asking:</p>
<p>Do you speak French?<br />
The language of love and summer<br />
That&#8217;s an opportunity for a French course<br />
But shame on him who thinks ill of it </p>
<p>He says to me: Do you speak French?<br />
But tonight, let me invite you<br />
To see the lights in a nice way<br />
To make love in good French</p>
<p>What happiness, without clouds, the true love<br />
When you cry (Of happiness?) To embrace (Delighted)<br />
Oh, such time of young madness</p>
<p>(Next year, more than a week, we&#8217;ll go there together)<br />
We&#8217;ll be&#8230; (It&#8217;s so beautiful) We&#8217;ll be&#8230; (It&#8217;s so beautiful)<br />
We&#8217;ll be like the Parisian beauties</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll say: Do you speak French?<br />
The language of love and summer<br />
That&#8217;s an opportunity for a French course<br />
But shame on him who thinks ill of it</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll say: Do you speak French?<br />
But tonight, let me invite you<br />
To see the lights in a nice way<br />
To make love in good French<br />
Olé!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll say: Do you speak French?<br />

But shame on him who thinks ill of it</p>
<p>Do you speak French?<br />
