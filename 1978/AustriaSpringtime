Mrs. Caroline Robinson<br />
Only flies with a balloon<br />
Because she&#8217;s tired of her broom<br />
As top-witch of this town</p>
<p>Mrs. Caroline Robinson<br />
Likes telepathy and television<br />
Sulphur, bang, Chanel and Bach<br />
Fashion makes her weak</p>
<p>If she wants it, everything is still<br />
Only the tower clock ticks<br />
Midnight, the sun laughs<br />
The moon snores without stopping</p>
<p>A miracle has happened<br />
And no one understands<br />
Why, for what, how&#8217;s that<br />
Today it&#8217;s witch show</p>
<p>Mrs. Caroline Robinson<br />
Is a sensation for men<br />
Sex appeal instead of the broomstick<br />
Ever since she dropped off her broom</p>
<p>Mrs. Caroline Robinson<br />
Likes telepathy and television<br />
Sulphur, bang, Chanel and Bach<br />
Fashion makes her weak</p>
<p>When a dog without a cause<br />
Reads the paper<br />
And studies the women without shame<br />
Believe what you see</p>
<p>A miracle has happened<br />
And no one understands<br />
Why, for what, how&#8217;s that<br />
Today it&#8217;s witch show</p>
<p>Mrs. Caroline Robinson<br />
Only flies with a balloon<br />
Because she&#8217;s tired of her broom<br />
As top-witch of this town</p>
