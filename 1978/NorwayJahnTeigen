<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Rest now, you are worn out<br />
Rest your body, before your power ebbs out<br />
Water is trickling into your shoes<br />
You are walking in the rain</p>
<p>Mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile after mile after mile</p>
<p>Search me if you&#8217;re longing<br />
Think in a different direction<br />
Come here, where I am, where the sun is near<br />
You can&#8217;t go</p>
<p>Mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile after mile after mile</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s far to go<br />
It is your longing that drives you<br />
Towards a light that you see, but I can&#8217;t</p>
<p>Just think, where will you end<br />
You have walked too long</p>
<p>Mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile after mile after mile</p>
<p>Just think, where will you end<br />
You have walked too long</p>
<p>Mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile after mile after mile<br />
After mile<br />
