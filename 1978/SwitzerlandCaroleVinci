Why not believe in the beautiful story<br />
That makes the hearts and seasons sing?<br />
I want to forget everything in your arms<br />
And start it all again with you<br />
Share the colours and the songs</p>
<p>Why not follow that beautiful story?<br />
Why not smile at the new day?<br />
We will escape my love<br />
And we will find again the song<br />
So that we will live finally in harmony</p>
<p>To live, we will be living a million joys<br />
To pass the hours like free birds<br />
To live, I want to live this musical dream<br />
To steal the stars of love</p>
<p>Why not believe in the beautiful story<br />
That makes the heart and the spring sing?<br />
My life has started with you<br />
The sun rose in happiness<br />
You made me find again my heart of a child</p>
<p>To live, I want to live, this musical dream<br />
To steal the stars of love<br />
To live, we will be living and turn back the hours<br />
To steal the stars of happiness<br />
