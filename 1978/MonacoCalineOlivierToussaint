The little girl who played with a hoop<br />
Say do you remember it?<br />
The little boy who played with a ball<br />
Yes, I remember it</p>
<p>Looking at the Italian sailing ships<br />
Oh yes, it was good<br />
There was a little park with swings<br />
And you gave me your hand</p>
<p>In the gardens of Monaco<br />
Chaplin could have met Garbo<br />
Vadim maybe embraced Bardot<br />
Like you and me</p>
<p>In the gardens of Monaco<br />
Among the flowers, between the birds<br />
Juliet must have met Romeo<br />
Like you and me</p>
<p>The little girl who threw sand at me<br />
Say, do you remember it?<br />
The little boy who stole cherries<br />
I loved him well</p>
<p>I loved you for a long time<br />
And you know that nothing has changed<br />
At the clear fountain<br />
There is always love to share</p>
<p>In the gardens of Monaco<br />
Chaplin could have met Garbo<br />
Vadim maybe embraced Bardot<br />
Like you and me</p>
<p>In the gardens of Monaco<br />
Among the flowers, between the birds<br />
Juliet must have met Romeo<br />
Like you and me</p>
<p>In the gardens of Monaco<br />
We will write a new scenario<br />
For you and me &#8211; it&#8217;ll be the most beautiful<br />
In the gardens of Monaco<br />
