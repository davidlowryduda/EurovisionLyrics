You really can change country if you don&#8217;t like the rain<br />
Go and live in the sun of Italy, if you want<br />
You really can change your guy if you don&#8217;t like my song<br />
And if you want, you can even make the revolution</p>
<p>But there will always be violins to play love songs<br />
But there will always be songs which say that it&#8217;s for ever<br />
But there will always be lovers to end up in Cherbourg<br />
But there will always be children to swear a great love</p>
<p>You really can wear jeans, trousers or a dinner jacket<br />
Live like a man, be free, if you want<br />
You really can say that marriage isn&#8217;t really for your age<br />
I know this feeling, for you, life is only a journey</p>
<p>But there will always be violins to play love songs<br />
But there will always be songs which say that it&#8217;s for ever<br />
But there will always be lovers to end up in Cherbourg<br />
But there will always be children to swear a great love</p>
<p>But there will always be violins to play love songs<br />
But there will always be songs which say that it&#8217;s for ever<br />
But there will always be lovers to end up in Cherbourg<br />
But there will always be children to swear a great love<br />
