Do you think: I can&#8217;t take it anymore?<br />
All those problems, every day<br />
Don&#8217;t you see the sun, but storm and rain?<br />
Is there only bad luck?</p>
<p>Then here&#8217;s a happy song<br />
The medicine for your problem<br />
Sing it along, then you&#8217;ll enjoy yourself<br />
Get rid of your sorrows, feel fine</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK, sing that melody<br />
Happily and in harmony<br />
Live with some sympathy<br />
For the people around you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK, sing that melody<br />
Happily and in harmony<br />
Strive for some sympathy<br />
Then you&#8217;re never alone</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you have a cent to buy something?<br />
Do your dreams never come true?<br />
And do you feel like running away?<br />
Then make a good decision immediately</p>
<p>Look around you, see other people<br />
Look at yourself and see immediately<br />
There&#8217;s not much to wish for<br />
When you&#8217;re healthy, you&#8217;re wealthy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK, sing that melody<br />
Happily and in harmony<br />
Live with some sympathy<br />
For the people around you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK, sing that melody<br />
Happily and in harmony<br />
Strive for some sympathy<br />
Then you&#8217;re never alone</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK, sing that melody<br />
Happily and in harmony<br />
Live with some sympathy<br />
For the people around you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OK, sing that melody<br />
Happily and in harmony<br />
Strive for some sympathy<br />
Then you&#8217;re never alone<br />
