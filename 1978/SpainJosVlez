Oh Michèle, where are you? I don&#8217;t know if you remember<br />
The summer we spent together, and which I could never forget<br />
Oh Michèle, I lost you, I&#8217;ve never heard something from you<br />
I just hope that you&#8217;ll come to me one day so I can ask you again</p>
<p>Do you want to dance with me? Do you want to dance a waltz?<br />
Nana nana nay na nana&#8230; nana nana nay na nana&#8230;<br />
Do you want to dance with me? Do you want to dance a waltz?<br />
Nana nana nai na nana&#8230; let&#8217;s dance a waltz</p>
