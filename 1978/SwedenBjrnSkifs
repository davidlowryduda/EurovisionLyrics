The days and the evenings, then I live<br />
I like my job, I have friends to talk to, it&#8217;s all right<br />
I go out and have a beer and listen to a band<br />
I guess I&#8217;ll dance, enjoying the warmth of some girl</p>
<p>But it always gets worse towards the night<br />
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter<br />
I lie awake, thinking about you<br />
Remembering too much and feeling lonely</p>
<p>I always come up with something to do, I do as I please<br />
I have nobody to take into consideration and no need to be punctual<br />
I go to the movies, play squash when I feel like it<br />
And I eat late and expensive and tasty and have a pretty good time in the evening</p>
<p>But it always gets worse towards the night<br />
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter<br />
I lie awake, thinking about you<br />
Remembering too much and feeling lonely</p>
<p>But it always gets worse towards the night<br />
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter<br />
I lie awake, thinking about you<br />
Remembering too much and feeling lonely</p>
<p>But it always gets worse towards the night<br />
Far away from all the lights and all the laughter<br />
But it always gets worse towards the night<br />
