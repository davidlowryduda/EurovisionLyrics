<p>Remember me?<br />
I was tossed and turnin&#8217; like a ship without a sea<br />
I was lost for learnin&#8217; like a song without a key</p>
<p>Remember when<br />
I was all alone without a soul to call my friend?<br />
Who&#8217;d have thought those days would ever end?</p>
<p>Those were the bad old days<br />
Before I had your love to guide me, sad old days<br />
You set me free from all those bad old days<br />
You put all the good inside of me</p>
<p>Those were the bad old days (Those were the sad old days)<br />
Before I had you there besides me, sad old days<br />
And can&#8217;t you see? &#8211; you took the bad old days<br />
And you put all the good inside of me</p>
<p>Remember who<br />
Walked into my life and put their foot inside my shoe<br />
Now what was just a place for one is home for two</p>
<p>Remember why<br />
I&#8217;m gonna stay with you until the day I die<br />
We can watch the good old days go by</p>
<p>Those were the bad old days<br />
Before I had your love to guide me, sad old days<br />
You set me free from all those bad old days<br />
You put all the good inside of me</p>
<p>Oh dooby-doo&#8230;<br />
Dooby-dooby-dooby-doo&#8230;<br />
Aah&#8230;</p>
<p>Those were the bad old days (Those were the sad old days)<br />
Before I had you there beside me<br />
Sad old days (Those were the sad old days)<br />
And can&#8217;t you see you took the bad old days<br />
And you put all the good inside of me?</p>
<p>(Those were the bad old days)<br />
(Those were the bad old days)<br />
You put all the good inside of me</p>
<p>(Those were the bad old days)<br />
Ah&#8230; (Those were the bad old days)<br />
You put all the good inside of me</p>
