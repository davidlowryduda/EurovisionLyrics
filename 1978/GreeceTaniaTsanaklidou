There he is, coming round the corner<br />
With a small black hat that suits<br />
In our childish anxiety<br />
The police inspector will most likely find him</p>
<p>A red carnation on his lapel<br />
A small cane, suit and ambitious<br />
The packet of cigarettes is empty<br />
And the sky started to rain</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, come in our dream to make us laugh<br />
Charlie Chaplin, whatever we see tonight, whatever you come up with<br />
Charlie Chaplin, the dream is silent like your movies<br />
Charlie Chaplin, let&#8217;s experience your stories again<br />
Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin</p>
<p>Employers and tough customers, that&#8217;s the society of Charlo<br />
A life full of illusions, a life with a a warm smile<br />
And the longer the movie lasted the more it took me away<br />
My God, may the adventure never end, my God, may the admission never end</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, come in our dream to make us laugh<br />
Charlie Chaplin, whatever we see tonight, whatever you come up with<br />
Charlie Chaplin, the dream is silent like your movies<br />
Charlie Chaplin, let&#8217;s experience your stories again<br />
Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Chaplin<br />
