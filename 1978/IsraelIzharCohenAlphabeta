<p>I love<br />
I love you<br />
I love<br />
I love you</p>
<p>I love<br />
Love you</p>
<p>When we were children<br />
We would love in secret<br />
Who were we nice to?<br />
Only to uncles and aunts</p>
<p>And the poor girls suffered<br />
Those sweethearts, they&#8217;d just get beaten up<br />
And what we really felt<br />
We whispered only in the Bet language</p>
<p>I love<br />
I love you<br />
I love<br />
I love you</p>
<p>Love is a beautiful word<br />
It&#8217;s a wondrous prayer, it&#8217;s a language<br />
Love is good to me<br />
It will always overcome<br />
And we shall speak in a language of love</p>
<p>I love<br />
I love you<br />
I love<br />
I love you</p>
<p>I dream and I wake up to three words<br />
And what is the world? Three words<br />
And that is how I feel now<br />
Just like back then, in the Bet language</p>
<p>I love<br />
I love you<br />
I love<br />
I love you</p>
<p>I love<br />
I love you<br />
I love<br />
I love you</p>
<p>I love<br />
I love you<br />
