What is it that&#8217;s wrong with me? I feel a bit unwell<br />
I think it&#8217;s problems or far too much smoke<br />
No, I don&#8217;t smoke and don&#8217;t drink at all<br />
Then it&#8217;s probably your fitness, that&#8217;s worse than you think</p>
<p>No, I went to see the doctor, and do you know what he said?<br />
That you should stop the good things in life, from today?<br />
I laid down on the couch, and he examined me<br />
What happened? What did he say? What&#8217;s wrong with you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only natural, the heart&#8217;s pounding away<br />
When you&#8217;re in love with a girl<br />
If you feel giant beats you easily get nervous<br />
It&#8217;s love, that&#8217;s knocking on the inside</p>
<p>And it goes boom boom, and boom boom of desire<br />
It feels like thunder here in my breast<br />
Yes, it goes boom boom and beats like possessed<br />
It&#8217;s pounding and beating day and night</p>
<p>Now I understand why you are so pale<br />
I&#8217;m pleased, but tell me: what do you think is on its way?<br />
It&#8217;s the great love, I know it from myself<br />
So you&#8217;ve felt the way I do, tell me, tell me, tell me</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only natural, the heart&#8217;s pounding away<br />
When you&#8217;re in love with a girl<br />
If you feel giant beats you easily get nervous<br />
It&#8217;s love, that&#8217;s knocking on the inside</p>
<p>And it goes boom boom, and boom boom of desire<br />
It feels like thunder here in my breast<br />
Yes, it goes boom boom and beats like possessed<br />
It&#8217;s pounding and beating day and night</p>
<p>And it goes boom boom, and boom boom of desire<br />
It feels like thunder here in my breast<br />
Yes, it goes boom boom and beats like possessed<br />
It&#8217;s pounding and beating day and night</p>
<p>Yes, it goes boom boom and beats like possessed<br />
It&#8217;s pounding and beating day and night<br />
