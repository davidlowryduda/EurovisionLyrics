<p>I said: &#8220;It would never work&#8221;, you said: &#8220;Let us try&#8221;<br />
I said: &#8220;I&#8217;m a travelling man who will only make you cry&#8221;<br />
And when the feeling hit me and I had to move along<br />
You said: &#8220;You were right, I guess, you must sing your song&#8221;</p>
<p>And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing<br />
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings<br />
And I missed you in the morning, but most of all at night<br />
And I couldn&#8217;t stop the music, though I tried with all my might</p>
<p>I lie in bed and watch the shadows moving on the wall<br />
And the loneliness is killing me, so I turn the radio on<br />
And I need you now, I want you in the slow morning light<br />
And the music makes it easier, but it doesn&#8217;t make it right</p>
<p>And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing<br />
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings<br />
And I missed you in the morning, but most of all at night<br />
And I couldn&#8217;t stop the music, though I tried with all my might</p>
<p>Some day I hope you will understand why I live this way<br />
Songs keep moving in my head, this music I must play<br />
So I pack my bags and once again I get out on the road<br />
Another day, maybe tonight, I might catch my soul</p>
<p>And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing<br />
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings<br />
And I missed you in the morning, oh but most of all at night<br />
And I couldn&#8217;t stop the music, though I tried with all my might</p>
<p>And a man is born to do one thing and I was born to sing<br />
And I must take the good times and the bad times that it brings<br />
And I missed you in the morning, oh but most of all at night<br />
And I couldn&#8217;t stop the music (Couldn&#8217;t stop the music)<br />
No, I couldn&#8217;t stop the music</p>
<p>Because I&#8230; hey, I was born&#8230; born to sing&#8230;<br />
Born to sing&#8230; born to sing&#8230; born to sing&#8230;</p>
