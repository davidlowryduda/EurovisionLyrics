<p>Time would pass me by if I<br />
Had never asked you why<br />
Your eyes were open wide<br />
That day you saw me cry</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not that kind of girl<br />
Who only dreams of pearls<br />
Just give me wings of love<br />
And make it real</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m not afraid of a blade<br />
That we need to cross today<br />
But I&#8217;m scared to be shared<br />
By someone else</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause this is gonna be<br />
The day that we will meet<br />
When heaven comes so down to earth<br />
To say hello from Mars</p>
<p>My emotions take me high<br />
They seem to reach the sky<br />
I still believe we try<br />
To hit the ground or fly</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not afraid of a blade<br />
That we need to cross today<br />
But I&#8217;m scared to be shared<br />
By someone else</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause this is gonna be<br />
The day that we will meet<br />
When heaven comes so down to earth<br />
To say hello from Mars</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause this is gonna be<br />
The day that we will meet<br />
When heaven comes so down to earth<br />
To say hello from Mars</p>
<p>Life is a mystery<br />
Like a perfect harmony<br />
No one knows the day when love<br />
Will come and set you free</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause this is gonna be<br />
The day that we will meet<br />
When heaven comes so down to earth<br />
To say hello from Mars</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause this is gonna be<br />
The day that we will meet<br />
When heaven comes so down to earth<br />
To say hello from Mars</p>
