<p>Hoohooh, hoohooh, hoohooh<br />
Haha, haha<br />
Give me your love</p>
<p>Oh, I can be the one you love forever<br />
I can be the dream of your heart<br />
Every single moment, oh, I&#8217;m thinking of you<br />
I wish you felt the same way that I do</p>
<p>Give me your love<br />
Give me all of your love, I&#8217;m the one for you<br />
And try to believe me<br />
I just wanna be there by your side</p>
<p>Give me your love<br />
Give me all of your love when the morning comes<br />
I&#8217;m waiting tonight and it feels so right<br />
Give me your love</p>
<p>You can turn the winter into summer, oh yeah<br />
You can be my wonder every day, mmm whoa&#8230;<br />
Every time I see you I just wanna hold you<br />
I wish you felt the same way that I do</p>
<p>Give me your love<br />
Give me all of your love, I&#8217;m the one for you<br />
And try to believe me<br />
I just wanna be there by your side</p>
<p>Give me your love<br />
Give me all of your love when the morning comes<br />
I&#8217;ve waited tonight and it feels so right<br />
Give me your love</p>
<p>Sometimes I think that you&#8217;re an angel<br />
And it&#8217;s plain to see that you can rescue me<br />
Rescue me</p>
<p>Give me your love<br />
Give me all of your love, I&#8217;m the one for you<br />
And try to believe me<br />
I just wanna be there by your side</p>
<p>Give me your love<br />
Give me all of your love when the morning comes<br />
I&#8217;ve waited tonight and it feels so right<br />
Give me your love</p>
