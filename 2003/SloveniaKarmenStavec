<p>It was a warm midsummer night<br />
He just came, made me feel alright<br />
For one look (Yeah, he&#8217;s got the look)<br />
For one touch (She really wanted him so much)<br />
Then he grabbed his old guitar, began to play</p>
<p>He sang to me: &#8220;Nananana&#8221;<br />
So naturally it set my heart on fire<br />
He truly was my one desire<br />
Oh baby, how he was, nana nanana</p>
<p>He sang to me: &#8220;Nananana&#8221;<br />
My God, he couldn&#8217;t get me any higher<br />
Was not supposed to be a liar<br />
But babe, that&#8217;s what he was, nana nanana</p>
<p>What a warm midsummer night<br />
I just wanted him to hold me real tight<br />

<p>He sang to me: &#8220;Nananana&#8221;<br />
