<p>Every time you close your eyes<br />
I can see the light that you&#8217;re hiding<br />
Like a shadow in the sky<br />
Of an eagle&#8217;s wing when it&#8217;s gliding</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid, I&#8217;m not gonna run away<br />
Don&#8217;t let it wait, until it&#8217;s too late<br />
For what you have to say</p>
<p>Open your heart, show me the pain<br />
It&#8217;s all part of who you are<br />
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears<br />
Just open your beating heart to me</p>
<p>Everything you share with me<br />
Turns a little darkness into light<br />
And that is how we&#8217;re meant to be<br />
Truth will keep the light shining brighter</p>
<p>Open your heart, show me the pain<br />
It&#8217;s all part of who you are<br />
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears<br />
Just open your heart to me</p>
<p>Reach out, I&#8217;m right by your side<br />
Exactly where I want to be<br />
The sum of you and me is we, yeah</p>
<p>Open your heart, show me the pain<br />
Show me who you are<br />
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears<br />
Just open your heart to me</p>
<p>Open your heart, show me the pain<br />
It&#8217;s all part of who you are<br />
Tell me your dreams, your hopes and your fears<br />
Let go and just show me who you are, yeah<br />
Hey&#8230; your heart</p>
<p>Let go and just show me who you are</p>
