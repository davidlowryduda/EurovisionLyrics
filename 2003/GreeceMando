<p>I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going through<br />
Close my eyes, still see you inside<br />
Everything reminds me of you<br />
I could never let you go</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t hide my feelings at all<br />
I give you love, sometimes it&#8217;s so hard<br />
Without you I know why I would fall<br />
I could never let you go</p>
<p>I would cry for you and I&#8217;d lie for you<br />
I would lay my life on the line<br />
I can&#8217;t hide from you, then I&#8217;d die for you<br />
But I&#8217;d never let you go</p>
<p>What we share keeps me alive<br />
For you there&#8217;s nothing I would deny<br />
All I know is I want you so<br />
I could never let you go</p>
<p>I would cry for you and I&#8217;d lie for you<br />
I would lay my life on the line<br />
I can&#8217;t hide from you, then I&#8217;d die for you<br />
But I&#8217;d never let you&#8230;<br />
Never let you go</p>
<p>(Cry for you)<br />
(Cry&#8230;)</p>
<p>I would cry for you and I&#8217;d lie for you<br />
I would lay my life on the line<br />
I can&#8217;t hide from you, reach the sky for you<br />
But I&#8217;d never let you go</p>
<p>Never let you go</p>
