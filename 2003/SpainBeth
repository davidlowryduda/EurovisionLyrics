A calm sea in the afternoon<br />
And everything will be as it was before<br />
I play with the sand between my feet<br />
Unresistingly I draw your name</p>
<p>How many times did I call you in the night?<br />
How many times did I look for you?<br />
I return for my memories<br />
And I don&#8217;t lose faith</p>
<p>Tell me what it is that I can do<br />
How I can keep you in my life<br />
Let&#8217;s forget yesterday<br />
And start again, without lies</p>
<p>Tell me what it is that I can do<br />
How I can keep you in my life</p>
<p>Someone told me that you&#8217;re the same<br />
And that you felt bad, like me<br />
Don&#8217;t let it be pride<br />
That decides for us two</p>
<p>Because you know that I love you<br />
And everything that I told you isn&#8217;t true<br />
Leave your fears, we can<br />
If you want to try again</p>
<p>Tell me what it is that I can do<br />
How I can keep you in my life<br />
Let&#8217;s forget yesterday<br />
And start again, without lies</p>
<p>Tell me what it is that I can do<br />
How I can keep you in my life</p>
<p>You and I know<br />
That we can&#8217;t live like this<br />
Come back to me</p>
<p>Tell me what it is that I can do<br />
How I can keep you in my life<br />
Let&#8217;s forget yesterday<br />
And start again, without lies</p>
<p>Tell me what it is that I can do<br />
How I can keep you in my life</p>
<p>Tell me, tell it to me<br />
