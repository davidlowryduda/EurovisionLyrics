<p>Nothing is as before since we got lost<br />
The rivers, the ocean, all the seas have fallen silent<br />
And the earth, and the earth for me no longer turns<br />
I examine the sky like a deluded angel</p>
<p>Oh, my love<br />
Where are you, my love?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known joy and then pain<br />
I was with you, I&#8217;m homeless<br />
I know I shouldn&#8217;t talk about it anymore<br />
At least try to forget a little</p>
<p>We promised each other the moon and the stars<br />
Not a single rainy day, only sunshine<br />
I know I shouldn&#8217;t talk about it anymore<br />
And I never ceased loving you</p>
<p>Yes, I know my heart which is now on the look-out<br />
A memory, even an illusion, and all my blood rushes back<br />
And the earth, and the earth for me no longer turns<br />
I&#8217;m naked and without wings like a fallen angel</p>
<p>Oh, my love<br />
Where are you, my love?<br />
Oh, my love<br />
Where are you, my love?</p>
<p>Lala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lala lalala&#8230;<br />
Nana nanana&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known joy and then pain<br />
I was with you, I&#8217;m homeless<br />
I know I shouldn&#8217;t talk about it anymore<br />
At least try to forget a little</p>
<p>We promised each other the moon and the stars<br />
Not a single rainy day, only sunshine<br />
I know I shouldn&#8217;t talk about it anymore<br />
And I never ceased loving you</p>
<p>The moon and the stars<br />
Only sunshine<br />
Not to talk about it anymore<br />
To forget a little</p>
<p>The moon and the stars<br />
Only sunshine<br />
Not to talk about it anymore<br />
And I never ceased loving you<br />
