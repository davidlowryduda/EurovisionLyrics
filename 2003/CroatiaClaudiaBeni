Ah ah&#8230;<br />
I don&#8217;t need someone who tells me<br />
Whether to walk on the road or where to turn off</p>
<p>And who are you, who judges me?<br />
You don&#8217;t need to try anymore, it&#8217;s all over now<br />
It&#8217;s too late now to learn<br />
You&#8217;ve lost me for too long, way too long</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not yours anymore, I&#8217;m not the one<br />
Who has to suffer for being loved<br />
I&#8217;ll be mine forever, whether I&#8217;m bad or good<br />
But for sure, I&#8217;ll trust myself</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need someone (To tell me)<br />
What I need, what I can do and what I can&#8217;t do</p>
<p>And who are you, who judges me?<br />
You don&#8217;t need to try anymore, it&#8217;s all over now<br />
It&#8217;s too late now to learn<br />
You&#8217;ve lost me for too long, way too long, oh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not yours anymore, I&#8217;m not the one<br />
