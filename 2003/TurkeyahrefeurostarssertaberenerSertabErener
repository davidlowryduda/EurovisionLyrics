<p>I feel you moving on a different course<br />
Making a way for a distant cause<br />
You say you love me and you roll your eyes<br />
Turn to stare at the empty skies</p>
<p>I thought it was over and we passed all that<br />
All we&#8217;ve done is to pass back to frame number one<br />
Come on now, now<br />
I wanna show you all again what it would be like<br />
If you just let go and let me love you</p>
<p>Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll try to make you love me again<br />
Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll give you all my love and then</p>
<p>Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll cry, I&#8217;ll die, make you mine again</p>
<p>Hold me closer, oh so good<br />
You make me feel just like I should<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking, uh-huh good<br />
Now the rest of the world is overruled</p>
<p>Tell me what you see in other girls all around<br />
Come on closer and tell me what you don&#8217;t find here<br />
Come on now, now<br />
I wanna give you everything, you&#8217;ve been missing out<br />
Just let go and let me love you</p>
<p>Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll try to make you love me again<br />
Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll give you all my love and then</p>
<p>Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll cry, I&#8217;ll die, make you mine again</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with you, I&#8217;ll do all you want me to<br />
You make me wanna huh-huh, make me wanna huh-huh-huh<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you, I&#8217;ll do all you want me to<br />
You make me wanna huh-huh, make me wanna huh-huh-huh</p>
<p>Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir<br />
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir<br />
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir<br />
Nothing in the world that could stop me, no sir<br />
No, no, no, no, no</p>
<p>Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll try to make you love me again<br />
Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll give you all my love and then</p>
<p>Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll give you all my love and then<br />
Everyway that I can<br />
I&#8217;ll cry, I&#8217;ll die, make you mine again</p>
