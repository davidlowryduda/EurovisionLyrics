<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Take the sun, take the sea<br />
Take with you the light of my moonlight<br />
Take the dawning, from the sky take the colour<br />
Leave the nightfall and my pain, and my pain</p>
<p>But when you go<br />
Let me dream only one more time<br />
And think you&#8217;re going to stay always beside me<br />
Make me believe only one more time<br />
That I&#8217;m still everything to you</p>
<p>Take the air that I breathe<br />
Leave my life without sense<br />
Take my smile, my heart<br />
Take my destiny in your hand, in your hand</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
