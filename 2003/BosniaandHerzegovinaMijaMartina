The day departs<br />
You slowly follow it, alone<br />
&#8216;Cause you will lose the game<br />
This game I have known for long<br />
(Down by the river where nobody goes)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, don&#8217;t worry about me<br />
Lies can&#8217;t hurt me<br />
Say, say what it feels like<br />
When everything is lost</p>
<p>You tell everyone that you don&#8217;t suffer<br />
That you don&#8217;t love me, baby (Baby)<br />
Now, fine, show me<br />
That you can do without me</p>
<p>Because only two words<br />
I have to tell you today:<br />
At least (At least), at least (at least) for the end</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, don&#8217;t worry about me<br />
Lies can&#8217;t hurt me<br />
Say, say what it feels like<br />
When everything is lost</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, don&#8217;t worry about me<br />
Lies can&#8217;t hurt me<br />
Say, say what it feels like<br />
When everything is lost</p>
