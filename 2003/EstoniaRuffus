<p>You thought you had it coming<br />
But now you really, really just don&#8217;t know<br />
It seems you make a deal far too big outta this</p>
<p>Aha, you thought that you&#8217;d done it<br />
Yeah, you thought that you had heard it all<br />
But the state of things is putting you down now<br />
Just because, whoah&#8230;</p>
<p>You know they say it&#8217;s just the eighties coming back<br />
Can you feel it&#8217;s the eighties coming back?<br />
Yeah, I know it&#8217;s just the eighties coming, eighties coming<br />
Eighties coming, eighties coming back</p>
<p>You said let&#8217;s do it<br />
Let&#8217;s take it out and dance all night<br />
But those deep synthesizer sounds freak you out<br />
Whoah&#8230;</p>
<p>And now you wake up in the middle of the night<br />
In terror, all you do is cry<br />
Cold sweat, a cup of tea, no nothing seems to help you through the night<br />
My God</p>
<p>Now, it feels just like the eighties coming back<br />
Can you feel it&#8217;s the eighties coming back?<br />
Yeah, I know it&#8217;s just the eighties coming, eighties coming<br />
Eighties coming, eighties coming back</p>
<p>Yeah, you thought you had it coming<br />
But now it looks like you didn&#8217;t know this<br />
But everybody&#8217;s wearing their hair the way you did fifteen years ago<br />
And it makes you wanna cry</p>
<p>Oh, it feels just like the eighties coming back<br />
Can you feel it? It&#8217;s the eighties coming back<br />
Yeah, I know it&#8217;s just the eighties coming, eighties coming<br />
Eighties coming, eighties coming back</p>
