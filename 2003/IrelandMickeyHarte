<p>She stands in the moonlight, she touches her hair<br />
Her smile adds emotion and her love fills the air<br />
And I know you&#8217;re my every tomorrow<br />
And I know that you&#8217;ll always be there</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got the world tonight (Tonight)<br />
Let&#8217;s hold on together<br />
And we&#8217;ve got a love that&#8217;s right (That&#8217;s right)<br />
So open your heart<br />
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;ve got tonight</p>
<p>We move even closer, with hope in our eyes<br />
&#8216;Cause love is the answer to the hurt and the lies<br />
And I know you&#8217;re my every tomorrow<br />
And I know that you&#8217;ll always be there</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got the world tonight (Tonight)<br />
Let&#8217;s hold on together<br />
And we&#8217;ve got a love that&#8217;s right (That&#8217;s right)<br />
So open your heart</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got the world tonight (Tonight)<br />
Let&#8217;s hold on together<br />
And we&#8217;ve got a love that&#8217;s right (That&#8217;s right)<br />
So open your heart</p>
<p>Ask me why (ask me why)<br />
The sun and the moon move around<br />
Ask me why (ask me why)<br />
My feet never touch the ground<br />
(Tell the truth) Tell the truth<br />
You take my breath away</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got the world tonight<br />
We&#8217;ve got the world tonight (Tonight)<br />
Let&#8217;s hold on together<br />
And we&#8217;ve got a love that&#8217;s right (That&#8217;s right)<br />
So open your heart</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got the world tonight (Tonight)<br />
Let&#8217;s hold on together, let&#8217;s hold on together<br />
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;ve got tonight</p>
