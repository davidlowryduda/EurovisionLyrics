<p>One more night</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fire that burns within us<br />
A flame that never dies<br />
Like a river that runs right through me<br />
A river, old and wise</p>
<p>A power that can&#8217;t be stopped, oh no<br />
If you&#8217;re with the one you love<br />
You&#8217;ll never rise above<br />
Being with the one you love</p>
<p>Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
And now and forever, baby come what may<br />
Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
Well, let me hold you now and please stay, one more night</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bright light that shines upon us<br />
A light as old as time<br />
And there&#8217;s a flower that keeps on growing<br />
As long as we two rhyme</p>
<p>A power that can&#8217;t be stopped, oh no<br />
If you&#8217;re with the one you love (If you&#8217;re with the one you love)<br />
You&#8217;ll never rise above<br />
Being with the one you love</p>
<p>Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
And now and forever, baby come what may<br />
Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
Well, let me hold you now and please stay, one more night</p>
<p>Take my hand and I will lead the way<br />
We&#8217;re all in need of a brighter day, yeah<br />
Take a stand and it&#8217;ll be okay<br />
You&#8217;re all I need, so don&#8217;t delay<br />
Come here and say, you&#8217;re gonna stay</p>
<p>One more night, give me one more day<br />
And now and forever, baby come what may</p>
<p>Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
Now and forever, baby come what may<br />
Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
Well, let me hold you now and please stay, yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>(One more night, give me one more day)<br />
(Now and forever, baby come what may)<br />
Give me one more night, give me one more day<br />
Well, let me hold you now (Let me hold you now)<br />
Please stay, one more night</p>
