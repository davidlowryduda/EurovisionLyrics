<p>Love, love&#8217;s not enough<br />
I need your trust<br />
But you don&#8217;t try anymore</p>
<p>Hon, you still turn me on<br />
Though your love has gone<br />
And I don&#8217;t wanna cry anymore<br />
I thought our love would last forever</p>
<p>Bye-bye, baby, lied to me, baby<br />
Must have been crazy<br />
Baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>Cry, cry, baby, lied to me, baby<br />
Survive without you, baby<br />
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>You&#8217;re living a lie<br />
You won&#8217;t say goodbye<br />
You just keep me hanging on</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got my whole life to live<br />
Got more love to give<br />
Got to get a life of my own</p>
<p>I know you&#8217;re looking for something else<br />
Not gonna settle for anything less, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Bye-bye, baby, you lied to me, baby<br />
I must have been crazy<br />
Baby, bye-bye (It&#8217;s your turn to cry)</p>
<p>Cry, cry, baby, you lied to me, baby<br />
I&#8217;ll survive without you, baby<br />
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>Bye-bye, baby, you lied to me, baby<br />
I must have been crazy, bye-bye<br />
Baby, bye-bye (It&#8217;s your turn to cry)</p>
<p>Cry, cry, baby, you lied to me, baby<br />
I&#8217;ll survive without you, baby<br />
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had enough of baby love<br />
I need a love that is strong and tough<br />
Someone to hold me when things get rough<br />
I need a love that is big enough</p>
<p>Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye, baby<br />
(It&#8217;s your turn to cry)<br />
Cry, cry, baby, cry, cry, baby<br />
(Baby, goodbye)</p>
<p>Bye-bye, baby, lied to me, baby<br />
Must have been crazy<br />
Baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>Cry, cry, baby, lied to me, baby<br />
Survive without you, baby<br />
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye<br />
Baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>Cry, cry, baby, you lied to me<br />
I must have been crazy<br />
Baby, it&#8217;s your turn to cry</p>
<p>Cry, cry, baby (Oh no)<br />
Cry, cry, baby (I don&#8217;t wanna cry)<br />
Cry, cry, baby<br />
Baby, bye, baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>Oh, baby, bye-bye<br />
(Oh yeah, don&#8217;t wanna cry no more)<br />
Oh, baby, bye-bye</p>
<p>Cry, baby, cry, baby<br />
Cry, baby, cry, baby<br />
Cry, baby</p>
