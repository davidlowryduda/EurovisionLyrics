The-the animals of the world<br />
I rather like them<br />
But more than anything I like<br />
The-the hares and the bears<br />
The bears</p>
<p>Soon all birds will die<br />
Soon all beetles will die<br />
Only Adam is lying in bed<br />
And reproduces with Eve</p>
<p>The hares live in the forest<br />
The cats in the meadows<br />
And the cockroaches<br />
They live under the tiles</p>
<p>Little hares have short noses<br />
And little cats have soft paws<br />
And Mrs Holle likes the wool<br />
Of the dromedary from Africa</p>
<p>Uh! The-the difference between people<br />
Between apes and primates<br />
It&#8217;s not much bigger<br />
Than between noodles and pancake stripes<br />
Pancake stripes</p>
<p>But whoever wants to know more<br />
About animals should study biology<br />
Or connect to my homepage<br />
To find it out yourself</p>
<p>Some animals have wings<br />
And others have fins<br />
Some live outdoors<br />
And others in cans</p>
<p>Little hares have short noses<br />
And little cats have soft paws<br />
And Mrs Holle likes the wool<br />
Of the dromedary from Africa<br />
