I wish I were an astronaut<br />
Who looks down to the earth from up there<br />
Because all those, who already were up there<br />
They all say it&#8217;s wonderful</p>
<p>Here you&#8217;ll feel time slower passing by<br />
Silence and peace that we miss so much<br />
And here today it could also be this way<br />
We&#8217;re small, but not necessarily bad</p>
<p>No borders, no flags<br />
From up there, the world is just beautiful<br />
No countries, no nations<br />
No wars can be seen from up there</p>
<p>Everyone should go there at least once<br />
To realise this struggle doesn&#8217;t make sense<br />
Perhaps it will take our stupid megalomania<br />
And instead of talking, we begin to love</p>
<p>No borders, no flags<br />
No stupid quarrels, no different races<br />
No wars, no states<br />
No wars can be seen from up there</p>
<p>Unlimited (Unlimited)<br />
Peace without flags (Peace without flags)<br />
From the height, borders can&#8217;t be seen anymore</p>
<p>Unlimited (Unlimited), unusually<br />
Without quarrels, explosions, rage and wars<br />
From up there the world is just beautiful<br />
