<p>One moment out of time<br />
Someone finds a secret waiting behind<br />
Knowing there&#8217;s an end to a glory<br />
End to a story so good, so divine</p>
<p>Heart, listen to your beating<br />
Never gonna stop unless there&#8217;s a doubt<br />
Never speak to someone that knows you<br />
More than yourself and the ghost that you hide</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m in love with a beautiful girl<br />
She&#8217;s the one from the magical world<br />
And I hold her now, when the rain starts to fall<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid to move on</p>
<p>Lay down with someone strange<br />
Dare to be the same, as always in time<br />
Slowly seek the end and its glory<br />
Worry to see if it&#8217;s gone deep inside</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m in love with a beautiful girl<br />
She&#8217;s the one from the magical world<br />
And I hold her now, when the rain starts to fall<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid (I&#8217;m not afraid)<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid to move on</p>
<p>I&#8217;m alone when the ghosts start to haunt<br />
I&#8217;m alone, but I know</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with a beautiful girl<br />
She&#8217;s the one from the magical world<br />
And I hold her now, when the rain starts to fall<br />
I&#8217;m not afraid, I&#8217;m not afraid to move on</p>
