<p>When you lay your eyes on me, the feeling sets me free<br />
You&#8217;re my vision of love, the very heart of life<br />
The last word</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you made me dream again<br />
Took me where I&#8217;ve never been<br />
You made me dream again</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me fall apart<br />
Please don&#8217;t break my heart, I love you<br />
Your kisses I would miss<br />
Your smile and your caress, I love you</p>
<p>Winter&#8217;s gone and summer comes around<br />
Like the love I&#8217;ve found</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m helpless as you, just drift away from me<br />
I miss you</p>
<p>And you made me dream again<br />
Took me where I&#8217;ve never been<br />
You made me dream again</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me fall apart<br />
Please don&#8217;t break my heart, I love you<br />
Your kisses I would miss<br />
Your smile and your caress, I love you</p>
<p>Winter&#8217;s gone and summer comes around<br />
Like the love I&#8217;ve found</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me fall apart<br />
Please don&#8217;t break my heart, I love you<br />
Your kisses I would miss<br />
Your smile and your caress, I love you</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me fall apart<br />
Please don&#8217;t break my heart, I love you (Don&#8217;t let me fall apart)<br />
Your kisses I would miss<br />
Your smile and your caress, I love you (Don&#8217;t let me fall)<br />
And you make me dream again</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let me (Down), don&#8217;t let me (go)<br />
Don&#8217;t let me fall apart<br />
Don&#8217;t let me fall apart, &#8217;cause I love you baby<br />
You&#8217;re the one who makes me dream</p>
