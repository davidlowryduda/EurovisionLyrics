As long as you are there, as long as you are near me<br />
As long as my eyes only see you<br />
As long as you are here, being lovely and faithful<br />
So long it can&#8217;t be anything more beautiful to me</p>
<p>Look at all my thoughts, they&#8217;re swaying, they&#8217;re staggering<br />
They will be with you always and I can&#8217;t help it<br />
As long as you are there, as long as you are near me<br />
So long it can&#8217;t be anything more beautiful to me</p>
<p>Even if you will go away then, going to the north forever<br />
You won&#8217;t notice my secret tears<br />
And if you asked me, then I would have to admit<br />
As long as you were there, so long everything was fine</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way life is: some things will go wrong<br />
Times of happiness pass by much too fast<br />
When you will go to the north then<br />
Believe me, even when you will go away<br />
As long as you are there, so long everything was fine<br />
