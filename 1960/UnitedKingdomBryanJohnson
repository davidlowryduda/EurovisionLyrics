<p>I once had a love and oh&#8230; I loved her very dearly<br />
She told me she loved me so, I thought she spoke sincerely<br />
But one day, away I found that she had flown<br />
And off to find that love of mine I set alone</p>
<p>Looking high, high, high, looking low, low, low<br />
Wondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?<br />
For if I, I, I don&#8217;t find my love, I know<br />
I shall die, die, die &#8217;cause I love her so</p>
<p>I journeyed across the sea, I sought her with devotion<br />
Oh, where she could really be? I&#8217;ve not the slightest notion<br />
But so bright the light of love within me shone<br />
I knew full well, what e&#8217;er befell, I must go on</p>
<p>Looking high, high, high, looking low, low, low<br />
Wondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?<br />
For if I, I, I don&#8217;t find my love, I know<br />
I shall die, die, die &#8217;cause I love her so</p>
<p>Due east over desert sands, due west where grass is greener<br />
I asked in a dozen lands but none had ever seen her<br />
It was clear, I fear, my quest was all in vain<br />
So I departed, sad at heart, for home again</p>
<p>Looking high, high, high, looking low, low, low<br />
Wondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?<br />
For if I, I, I don&#8217;t find my love, I know<br />
I shall die, die, die &#8217;cause I love her so</p>
<p>But when I arrived, all brown and tanned by wind and weather<br />
You sure could have knocked me down with the proverbial feather<br />
She stood there, so fair and sweetly she confessed<br />
That she&#8217;d been wrong and all along she&#8217;d loved me best</p>
<p>I&#8217;d looked high, high, high, I&#8217;d looked low, low, low<br />
Wondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?<br />
Now that I, I, I have found my love, I know<br />
Till I die, die, die, I will love her so</p>
<p>(Looking high, high, high, looking low, low, low)<br />
(Wondering why, why, why did she go, go, go?)<br />
For if I, I, I don&#8217;t find my love, I know<br />
I shall die, die, die &#8217;cause I love her so<br />
(Looking high, high, high)</p>
