You&#8217;re romantic, you&#8217;re romantic<br />
Loving you is a little bit reviving</p>
<p>Brunette girl<br />
I&#8217;m the last romantic who sings to the moon<br />
Beautiful girl<br />
I am the last poet who was inspired by a star</p>
<p>And I love you<br />
Because you are like me &#8211; romantic</p>
<p>You&#8217;re romantic, loving you is a little bit reviving<br />
In the simplicity, in the fantasy of another age<br />
You&#8217;re romantic, a friend of the clouds<br />
Which are searching for a little bit of sun above, as you do</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the music that inspires the soul<br />
You&#8217;re my corner of paradise, down here</p>
<p>And I, next to you, have come back to live<br />
I&#8217;ll tell and confide my dreams to you<br />
Because you&#8217;re romantic</p>
<p>(You&#8217;re romantic, loving you is a little bit reviving)<br />
(In the simplicity, in the fantasy of another age)<br />
You&#8217;re the music that inspires the soul<br />
You&#8217;re my corner of paradise, down here</p>
<p>And I, next to you, have come back to live<br />
I&#8217;ll tell and confide my dreams to you<br />
Because romantic, because romantic<br />
Because you&#8217;re romantic<br />
