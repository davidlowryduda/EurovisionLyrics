Imagine what romance<br />
And charm there once was in the world<br />
Then you&#8217;d dance briskly to music by Lumbye<br />
And sweet tralulaley, yes</p>
<p>Yes, that was when you&#8217;d go courting on the old banks<br />
With crinolines and sunshades<br />
And the whole world didn&#8217;t know grudge and malice<br />
It was a lovely time</p>
<p>And if a girl was asked out, she&#8217;d go to her mother<br />
And say &#8220;May I&#8230;&#8221;, no matter how old she was<br />
And the gentleman and the lady would go to a café<br />
It was a lovely time</p>
<p>That was when everything was so nice<br />
It was wonderful in the king&#8217;s old city<br />
That was when life was so happy<br />
You just walked around being cheerful</p>
<p>Yes, that was when you&#8217;d go courting on the old banks<br />
And the city was asleep when it stroke twelve<br />
And there was nobody who&#8217;d dream of fights and conflicts<br />
It was a lovely time<br />
It was a lovely time</p>
<p>Then there was not a car<br />
And no Bellevue<br />
And the ladies&#8217; smiles were shy with appeal<br />
And sweet tralulaley, yes</p>
<p>Yes, that was when you&#8217;d go courting on the old banks<br />
With crinolines and sunshades<br />
And the whole world didn&#8217;t know grudge and malice<br />
It was a lovely time</p>
<p>And if a girl was asked out, she&#8217;d go to her mother<br />
And say &#8220;May I&#8230;&#8221;, no matter how old she was<br />
And the gentleman and the lady would go to a café<br />
It was a lovely time</p>
<p>That was when everything was so nice<br />
It was wonderful in the king&#8217;s old city<br />
That was when life was so happy<br />

<p>Yes, that was when you&#8217;d go courting on the old banks<br />
And the city was asleep when it stroke twelve<br />
And there was nobody who&#8217;d dream of fights and conflicts<br />
It was a lovely time<br />
It was a lovely time<br />
