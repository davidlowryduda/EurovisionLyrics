My love for you, it&#8217;s like the sea<br />
When nobody has walked on the sand yet<br />
My love for you, it&#8217;s like winter<br />
When the star found its stable</p>
<p>I share with you the paving stones of the road<br />
A clear dawn, ice water and bread<br />
My love for you, it&#8217;s like the sea<br />
The blue sky of winter, a tender dawn and clear water</p>
<p>A little wind is spinning<br />
Round an old bell-tower of a church<br />
Four boats on the gray sea<br />
A small ball painted in neon</p>
<p>And under my tiny room<br />
The broken echo of a fanfare<br />
That makes a song dance<br />
On my nocturnal intoxications</p>
<p>My love for you, it&#8217;s like the sea<br />
When nobody has walked on the sand yet<br />
My love for you, it&#8217;s like the winter<br />
When the star found its cattle shed</p>
<p>I share with you the paving stones of the road<br />
A clear dawn, ice water and bread<br />
My love for you, it&#8217;s like the sea<br />
The blue sky of winter, a tender dawn and clear water</p>
<p>My love, my love for you<br />
