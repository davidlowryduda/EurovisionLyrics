That night you only had your youth<br />
To offer me like a bouquet of spring<br />
In the love that often disappointed me<br />
I didn&#8217;t believe anymore, but when I saw you</p>
<p>That night I wanted to invent<br />
Words that had never existed<br />
Words of love in full dress<br />
For that night</p>
<p>In your arms, I understood that from that night<br />
Life would never have attraction for me<br />
Far from you</p>
<p>My love, I have given you the best<br />
The best of the deepest of my heart<br />
Of my heart that is still saving the tenderness<br />
Of that night</p>
<p>That night, but what good is returning?<br />
All that is for me only a memory<br />
But I&#8217;ve never been able to free myself from a crazy dream<br />
That I cherished</p>
<p>I had given you much more than my life<br />
But maybe you didn&#8217;t understand<br />
That you tore my childhood dream<br />
By leaving me</p>
<p>And still if you come back to me one day<br />
In my heart, I save like the first day<br />
So much love</p>
<p>So much love always for you who I&#8217;m waiting for<br />
Who I&#8217;m waiting for like someone waiting for spring<br />
Spring, my arms full of lilacs<br />
For that night</p>
<p>My love, I&#8217;ll wait for you every day<br />
As long as I live, I&#8217;ll be there<br />
That night<br />
