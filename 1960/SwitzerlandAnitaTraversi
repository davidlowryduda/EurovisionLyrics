Heaven and earth, dream and life<br />
On the road to the one who loves you, like me<br />
The limit of a date<br />
You weren&#8217;t there and instead you&#8217;re with me now</p>
<p>With thoughts, with words it colours<br />
A name hidden away in the bottom of my heart<br />
It&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve got my sun<br />
But I wonder: will he still be mine tomorrow?</p>
<p>One hour of sweet intimacy is too short<br />
Why should I bother? What is it good for?</p>
<p>Heaven and earth, dream and life<br />
On the road to the one who loves you, like me<br />
The limit of a date<br />
I didn&#8217;t know about you and now I know everything</p>
<p>One hour of sweet intimacy is too short<br />
Why should I bother? What is it good for?</p>
<p>Heaven and earth, dream and life<br />
On the road to the one who loves you, like me<br />
The limit of a date<br />
I didn&#8217;t know about you and now I know everything</p>
<p>Heaven and earth, dream and life<br />
