In a little valley, far up North<br />
Where the sun shines all night long<br />
In a little valley, way up North<br />
I heard a Sami girl sing</p>
<p>It seems the song arrived on a wind<br />
The wind from the south brought it over the sea<br />
The girl was so fair and light at heart<br />
And rhythm was her gift at the cradle</p>
<p>In a little valley, happy as few others were<br />
I heard a song that went like this:</p>
<p>Voi voi, way up in the mountains, can you hear this greeting from me?<br />
Voi voi, I want to tell you that I&#8217;m waiting for you<br />
Voi voi, time is standing still when I&#8217;m waiting for my sweetheart<br />
Voi voi, our fate was that I were to be yours</p>
<p>Voi voi, in a few days it will be Saturday you know<br />
Voi voi, then a wonderful dream will become reality<br />
Voi, soon you&#8217;ll come down to the valley and your sweetheart<br />
Voi voi, the week is over, saturday night will be nice<br />
Saturday night will be nice</p>
<p>Voi voi, in a few days it will be Saturday you know<br />
Voi voi, then a beautiful dream will become reality<br />
Voi, soon you&#8217;ll come down to the valley and your sweetheart<br />
Voi voi, the week is over, saturday night will be nice<br />
Saturday night will be nice, saturday night will be nice</p>
<p>Voi voi<br />
