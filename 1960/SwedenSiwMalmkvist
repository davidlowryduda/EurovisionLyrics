<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Only, only you and I<br />
Have to be apart every day<br />
While all the others get each other</p>
<p>Why does it have to be that way?<br />
Why does it have to happen to us<br />
When all the others get each other?</p>
<p>If I only had the courage to propose<br />
You would probably give me your &#8216;yes&#8217;<br />
But happiness has to wait<br />
Until I&#8217;ve picked up the courage some day</p>
<p>I go to weddings<br />
But I sit and watch<br />
How all the others get each other</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be arranged<br />
And then it would all be easy<br />
If you could propose like they used to<br />
By correspondence</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; dearest, maybe one day<br />
Maybe also you and I<br />
Like all the others, we will have each other<br />
