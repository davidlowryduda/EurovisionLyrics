<em>Ladies and gentlemen, please</em><br />
<em>Put your</em> chubby little <em>hands together</em><br />
<em>For the sensational super sack of German television</em><br />
<em>Stefan Raab</em></p>
<p>Oh my God, he&#8217;s real!<br />
Wow&#8230; he went to America and said:<br />
&#8220;If I make it there&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m never coming back to Germany again&#8221;<br />
And tonight, he&#8217;s here again! Wow!</p>
<p>What do you have there?</p>
<p>What do you have there? What do you have there?<br />
What do you have there? What do you have there?</p>
<p>Does he have something there then, and if so, what is it?<br />
Does he have something bald there, or rather some hair?<br />
Does he have something there which no one else has?<br />
Or does he have that on top of what he has there?</p>
<p>That what he has there, he just has there now<br />
Although it was not clear at all, that that was that there<br />
What that was, that was unclear<br />
So come on, tell me yet, please, what do you have there?</p>
<p>(I am so curious, I just wanna know whatta you there have)<br />
(I am so curious, I just wanna know whatta you there have)</p>
<p>What do you have there?</p>
<p>What do you have there? What do you have there?<br />
What do you have there? What do you have there?</p>
<p>Aha&#8230; what do you have there?<br />
What you have there, I had for a year already<br />
No, no, it was neither that, that or that there<br />
What do you mean that that was something?<br />
I thought that that that was</p>
<p>What that was there, that is still not clear<br />
And if it was dull, flat, smooth, full, or whatever<br />
That that was something, and if so, what that was there<br />
Please, please, tell me, what do you have there?</p>
<p>(I am so curious, I just wanna know whatta you there have)<br />
(I am so curious, I just wanna know whatta you there have)</p>
<p>What do you have there?</p>
<p>What do you have there? What do you have there?<br />
What do you have there? What do you have there?</p>
<p>What do you have there? What do you have there?<br />
What do you have there? What do you have there?</p>
<p>What do you have there? What do you have there?<br />
Oh my God!<br />
