I wake up in the morning, the coffee I made yesterday is still hot<br />
The rain over the window is reading my thoughts<br />
I wonder where my absent love is, the telephone has not rung<br />
Your smile makes me crazy, I can&#8217;t wait anymore</p>
<p>I know it was not easy, my fragile heart<br />
Is burning in a moment and flies straight with the wind<br />
I feel like a little seawave, the blueness of love<br />
Now you are in my days</p>
<p>Where is life? What is life?<br />
A thorn which hurts my heart if you are not here<br />
Where is life? What is life?<br />
A balcony of love with no applause if you are not here</p>
<p>Divide the world with me, make me live every day<br />
To shine like the light of a star<br />
To live love in the sky, is such a beautiful thing<br />
Hold me strongly, kiss me</p>
<p>Where is life? What is life?<br />
A thorn which hurts my heart if you are not here<br />
Where is life? What is life?<br />
A balcony of love with no applause if you are not here<br />
If you are not here<br />
