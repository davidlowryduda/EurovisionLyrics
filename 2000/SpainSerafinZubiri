Hanging from a dream<br />
High in the sky, I try to live<br />
The world in the distance<br />
Seems small, seen from here</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what people say of me<br />
That I don&#8217;t have my feet on the floor<br />
They don&#8217;t know that I fly instead of sleeping</p>
<p>There are no limits to my wishes here<br />
Nothing can be forbidden<br />
I&#8217;m sailing free through my thoughts<br />
Don&#8217;t take me off of here</p>
<p>There is room for my longings here<br />
Everything can come true<br />
Don&#8217;t make me go to the floor<br />
I just want to remain</p>
<p>Hanging from a dream<br />
Floating in the air without fear to fall<br />
The world is small<br />
And all my anxieties don&#8217;t fit into it</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what people say of me<br />
That I don&#8217;t have my feet on the floor<br />
Hanging from my dream, I manage to live</p>
<p>There are no limits to my wishes here<br />
Nothing can be forbidden<br />
I&#8217;m sailing free through my thoughts<br />
Don&#8217;t take me off of here</p>
<p>There is room to my longings here<br />
Everything can come true<br />
Don&#8217;t make me go to the floor<br />
I just want to remain</p>
<p>Hanging from a dream<br />
Hanging from a dream<br />
Hanging from a dream<br />
