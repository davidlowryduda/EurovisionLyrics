And in your eyes, my eyes, to dive, to cross the ocean<br />
To finally put my hand on you<br />
And in your arms, my arms, to fall, taken by the impulse<br />
To finally let my fingers slide</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
A little bit like angels, wings, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I<br />
We&#8217;ll have the honey<br />
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I</p>
<p>And on your skin, my salty skin, to savour the moments<br />
At night, to finally laze a little bit on you, my baby<br />
And in your heart, my heart, to shine, to put down a diamond<br />
At night, to finally think a little bit of me</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
A little bit like angels, wings, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I<br />
We&#8217;ll have the honey<br />
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; to play with clouds under the blue sky, my baby<br />
To play with clouds under the blue sky<br />
We&#8217;ll have the sun deeply in our eyes, my baby<br />
We&#8217;ll have the sun deeply in our eyes</p>
<p>And on your heart, my heart, light, taken by the wind<br />
Oh&#8230; you and I</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
A little bit like angels, wings, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I<br />
We&#8217;ll have the honey<br />
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
(And on your skin, my salty skin, to savour the moments)<br />
We&#8217;re flying away, you and I</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
(And on your heart, my heart, to shine, to put down a diamond)<br />
We&#8217;re flying away, you and I</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
A little bit like angels, wings, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I<br />
We&#8217;ll have the honey<br />
A taste of orange, cinnamon, we&#8217;re flying away, you and I</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have the sky<br />
