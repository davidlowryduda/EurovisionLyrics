<p>I knew it all from the start<br />
I knew you&#8217;ll rise above my world<br />
A little sun warming my heart</p>
<p>I betrayed myself, I knew I lied<br />
You&#8217;ve searched into my soul to find love<br />
And found me hiding deep inside<br />
You did see a way to set me free</p>
<p>Now I hear when the wind is playing with the stars of my night<br />
Simply &#8217;cause I have you near<br />
Now I feel when the moon is playing on and on and on with my heart<br />
Simply &#8217;cause your love is real<br />
Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>I knew it all, I understood<br />
I simply blinked and let the light<br />
Give me reasons to be good<br />
You did see a way to set me free</p>
<p>Now I hear when the wind is playing with the stars of my night<br />
Simply &#8217;cause I have you near<br />
Now I feel when the moon is playing on and on and on with my heart<br />
Simply &#8217;cause your love is real<br />
Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, I feel when the moon is playing<br />
Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Now I hear how the wind is playing with the stars of my night<br />
Simply &#8217;cause I have you near<br />
Now I feel when the moon is playing on and on and on with my heart<br />
Simply &#8217;cause your love is real<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
