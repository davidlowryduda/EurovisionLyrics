<p>Don&#8217;t you know what you are doing to me?<br />
This ain&#8217;t the way to work things out<br />
Tell me something that I&#8217;ve never heard before<br />
We gotta get off this crazy roundabout</p>
<p>No more doubting, no more fears<br />
No more cheating, no more tears<br />
No more questions, no more lies<br />
No farewells, no goodbyes<br />
No goodbyes</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why you keep saying:<br />
&#8220;Oh, everything&#8217;s just fine, there&#8217;s nothing wrong&#8221;<br />
Something&#8217;s been happening that we cannot ignore<br />
It&#8217;s time for us to sing a different song</p>
<p>No more doubting, no more fears<br />
No more cheating, no more tears<br />
No more questions, no more lies<br />
No farewells, no goodbyes<br />
No goodbyes</p>
<p>Oh, don&#8217;t say anything you&#8217;ll wish you hadn&#8217;t said<br />
Just say nothing at all (Say nothing at all)<br />
&#8216;Cause I know love will grow when you go<br />
Don&#8217;t say goodbye, oh no</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t say goodbye, no goodbyes<br />
(No goodbyes)<br />
Don&#8217;t say anything you&#8217;ll wish you hadn&#8217;t said, my baby<br />
(No goodbyes)<br />
Oh no, oh no, no</p>
<p>(Yeah&#8230;)<br />
No farewells, no goodbyes</p>
