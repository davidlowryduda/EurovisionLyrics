<p>Sitting alone here in my room<br />
Staring at your picture from midnight till noon<br />
Counting the hours, counting the days<br />
You know that I&#8217;ll miss you in a million ways </p>
<p>Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old<br />
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride<br />
When you see me in the hall, I&#8217;ll look at the wall<br />
By my actions you should know<br />
I&#8217;m going solo, going solo </p>
<p>My friends try to tell me, I didn&#8217;t want to listen<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;m the kind of person gotta find out on my own<br />
I gave you my heart, you tore it apart<br />
But I&#8217;m coming back strong, I knew it was wrong </p>
<p>Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old<br />
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride<br />
When you see me in the hall, I&#8217;ll look at the wall<br />
By my actions you should know </p>
<p>Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old<br />
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride<br />
When you see me in the hall, I&#8217;ll look at the wall<br />
By my actions you should know<br />
I&#8217;m going solo, going solo </p>
<p>Now I wait&#8230;<br />
Wait in the cold and this is getting old<br />
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride<br />
When you see me in the hall, I&#8217;ll look at the wall<br />
By my actions you should know </p>
<p>Now I wait in the cold and this is getting old<br />
No more stories, no more lies, take me off this ride<br />
When you see me in the hall, I&#8217;ll look at the wall<br />
By my actions you should know<br />
I&#8217;m going solo</p>
