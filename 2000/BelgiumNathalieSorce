How to live without love?<br />
How to live without love?<br />
How to live the wish to live?</p>
<p>Beyond thoughts, beyond love<br />
We have to share far more every day<br />
Under the wrath of time furious for 2000 years<br />
What&#8217;s left standing, it&#8217;s not us</p>
<p>Between good and bad, lots of other feelings<br />
Following the only star to the glory of the living God<br />
Through the passions and distrusting all seasons<br />
What&#8217;s left standing, it&#8217;s not us, but</p>
<p>The wish to live for eternity<br />
The wish to live passed us by<br />
The wish to live will remain engraved<br />
Like in a book we have forgotten about</p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t survive in a world without love<br />
The gates of life will need it every day<br />
How could we see a smile in every look<br />
If square one is devoid of any hope?</p>
<p>So I want to live, live to give<br />
The wish to live and the wish to love</p>
<p>The wish to live for eternity<br />
The wish to live passed us by<br />
The wish to live will remain engraved<br />
Like in a book we have discovered again</p>
<p>How to live without love?<br />
How to live without love?<br />
How to live the wish to live?<br />
