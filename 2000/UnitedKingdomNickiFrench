<p>Once I had a dream<br />
I thought we had everything<br />
Living such a perfect life, we had it all<br />
And our love took flight deep into the night</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m alone again<br />
But I&#8217;m&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna be strong<br />
And the tears that I have cried you&#8217;ll never see<br />
Oh&#8230; but crying in vain was never for me</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
Reminding me of how it used to be<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
I wish it could be like before<br />
When you were here with me, oh yeah</p>
<p>Oh deejay, please don&#8217;t play<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again (Song again)</p>
<p>Time, time changes everything<br />
And that&#8217;s what they say<br />
But it&#8217;s too late for regrets when all&#8217;s said and done<br />
It just wasn&#8217;t meant to be, now I&#8217;m the lonely one</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
Reminding me of how it used to be<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
I wish it could be like before<br />
When you were here with me, oh yeah</p>
<p>Oh deejay, please don&#8217;t play<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
Reminding me of how it used to be<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
I wish it could be like before<br />
When you were here with me, oh yeah</p>
<p>Oh deejay, please don&#8217;t play<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again (song again)</p>
<p>No&#8230; oh deejay, please don&#8217;t play<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again<br />
That song again<br />
Don&#8217;t play that song again&#8230;</p>
