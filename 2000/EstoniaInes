<p>I don&#8217;t wish I could turn back time<br />
I can move the mountains higher than high<br />
Don&#8217;t look back, hold on to your spirit<br />
Keep moving every minute</p>
<p>I know it seems a little premature<br />
To live for the moment, I&#8217;m just a girl<br />
Don&#8217;t look back, hold on to your spirit<br />
Keep moving every minute</p>
<p>What you give is what you get<br />
There ain&#8217;t no regrets</p>
<p>If you give me wings and reason why<br />
Then I&#8217;ll be an angel in your sky<br />
Because I&#8217;m seventeen only once in a lifetime<br />
Read my mind</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready, why are you standing still?<br />
Are you coming with me? &#8211; I know you will<br />
We can search the world together<br />
Come on, baby, now or never</p>
<p>What you give is what you get<br />
There ain&#8217;t no regrets</p>
<p>If you give me wings and reason why<br />
Then I&#8217;ll be an angel in your sky<br />
Because I&#8217;m seventeen only once in a lifetime<br />
Read my mind</p>
<p>If you give me wings and reason why<br />
Then I&#8217;ll be an angel in your sky<br />
Because I&#8217;m seventeen only once in a lifetime<br />
Read my mind</p>
<p>I believe there&#8217;s a better place always<br />
Somewhere else instead<br />
I believe the grass is greener if I chase<br />
The magic no one else can find<br />
(The magic no one else can find)</p>
<p>If you give me wings and reason why<br />
Then I&#8217;ll be an angel in your sky<br />
Because I&#8217;m seventeen only once in a lifetime<br />
Read my mind</p>
<p>If you give me wings and reason why<br />
Then I&#8217;ll be an angel in your sky<br />
Because I&#8217;m seventeen only once in a lifetime<br />
Read my mind</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m seventeen only once in a lifetime</p>
