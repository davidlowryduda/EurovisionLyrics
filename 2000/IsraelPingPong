<p>All day long I sit in the kibbutz<br />
In my hand a cigar and it feels a little sour<br />
All the time only depression and boredom<br />
If I don&#8217;t come, it will end with a bang</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; happy</p>
<p>All day long wars on television<br />
And in Australia there are floods again<br />
Here comes the Sunday depression<br />
I want, I want a cucumber</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; happy</p>
<p>And now I have a new boyfriend from Damascus<br />
When I&#8217;m sad, he sends me a red rose<br />
It&#8217;s not smart to love only when you feel like it<br />
I want to do it with him all day long</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; happy<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; happy<br />
