<p>I&#8217;m in love with the place where I was born<br />
Where I lived my life in harmony with every new dawn<br />
I&#8217;m in love with the people that I know<br />
With whom I share my tears of laughter, the times I feel low</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit of love, it&#8217;s a little love I need<br />
To keep me going, keep me smiling<br />
It&#8217;s love that makes me breathe</p>
<p>It may be Finland, France or Spain<br />
Berlin, Prague or Rome<br />
It&#8217;s the place where you live<br />
Where your heart feels at home</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a world that is bigger than my own<br />
Where they strive to try and unify, to dull monotone<br />
Every change that really matters comes from within<br />
When in love we stand together through thick and thin</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit of love, it&#8217;s a little love we need<br />
To keep us going, keep us smiling<br />
It&#8217;s love that makes us breathe</p>
<p>It may be Amsterdam or Bern<br />
Sweden or U.K.<br />
Where your heart is at home<br />
You will feel okay</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s a little bit of love), it&#8217;s a little love we need<br />
To keep us going, keep us smiling<br />
It&#8217;s love that makes us breathe</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit of love, it&#8217;s a little love we need<br />
To keep us going, keep us smiling<br />
It is love that makes us breathe</p>
<p>To keep us going, keep us smiling<br />
It is love that makes us breathe</p>
