Look, every tear is rolling down my cheek<br />
My sheet of the past is turning yellow<br />
The tracks are covered up, the colours are fading<br />
Memories without love</p>
<p>Play it for me for the last time<br />
Take the sorrow from my heart<br />
Take the memories without love and carry them far away<br />
I suffer from their sadness</p>
<p>Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don&#8217;t speak?<br />
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I&#8217;m weary<br />
Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don&#8217;t speak?<br />
Do you still close your eyes to me? Understand that I&#8217;m weary</p>
<p>At last the tracks are covered<br />
The colours are fading<br />
Memories without love</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Cry for the song that&#8217;s playin&#8217; round and round<br />
You used to sing just for me all alone<br />
And it hurts my heart to know the love we shared so long<br />
Will follow you like a nightmare, then you will care</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Do you hear the sound of silence<br />
The moment I don&#8217;t wanna talk and cry?<br />
Do you really close your eyes?<br />
Don&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m weary? Tell me why</em></font></p>

<p>Do you hear my aggrieved silence the moment I don&#8217;t speak?<br />
Do you still close your eyes to me?<br />
I won&#8217;t come back to you, keep me secretly in your heart<br />
Understand me at last, I&#8217;m weary<br />
