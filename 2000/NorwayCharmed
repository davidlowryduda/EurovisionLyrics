<p>Wooh!</p>
<p>Summer, Saturday and sunshine, suddenly, I saw you there<br />
A stunning sight from God knows where<br />
You were standing in the shadows, looking quite impossible<br />
I lost my mind and popsicle</p>
<p>A radio was singing<br />
Something blue in perfect tune<br />
Half a look over your shoulder<br />
I couldn&#8217;t keep from staring back at you</p>
<p>My heart goes boom when I see you, baby<br />
Don&#8217;t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon<br />
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me<br />
Say you&#8217;re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon<br />
My heart goes boom</p>
<p>Summer, Saturday, and sunset, you said hello and I said hi<br />
And something lit the evening sky<br />
You came out of the shadows with a teasing twinkle in your eye<br />
And took my senses for a ride</p>
<p>A radio was playing<br />
Something slow in perfect tune<br />
Half a smile as you sat down<br />
I couldn&#8217;t seem to keep my eyes off you</p>
<p>My heart goes boom when I see you, baby<br />
Don&#8217;t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon<br />
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me<br />
Say you&#8217;re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon<br />
(My heart goes boom)</p>
<p>A radio was singing<br />

Half a look over your shoulder<br />
I couldn&#8217;t seem to keep my eyes off you</p>
<p>My heart goes&#8230;<br />
My heart goes boom when I see you, baby<br />
Don&#8217;t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon<br />
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me<br />
Say you&#8217;re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon</p>
<p>My heart goes boom<br />
Oh baby, my heart goes boom</p>
