<p>I never was the one to carry on<br />
But everything is different since you came along<br />
In the middle of something special, I never felt this way before<br />
Now I need a little time to understand a little more</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t explain the way you made me feel (Made me feel)<br />
Or the moment that my heart began to reel (Reel)<br />
You took me in a new direction, you&#8217;re showin&#8217; me a different way (Different way)<br />
Now I&#8217;m in a situation, I will be the one to say</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you take me, my baby<br />
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me<br />
Let me be your one and only<br />
Love me like you do and let me give my lovin&#8217; all to you<br />
Oh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Now I know it&#8217;s love, and that&#8217;s a fact (That&#8217;s a fact)<br />
No return, there is no goin&#8217; back (No, no, no, no)<br />
It might be the way you make me crazy, you always take my breath away<br />
And now there&#8217;s only one thing, baby, that there&#8217;s left for me to say</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you take me, my baby<br />
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me<br />
I will always be by your side<br />
Always on my mind, my baby, take me</p>
<p>And everything I feel is from the bottom of my heart (Yeah&#8230;)<br />
I&#8217;ll give you everything I have, I&#8217;ll give you what you never had</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you take me, my baby<br />
Hold me for all time and never leave me, believe me<br />
I will always be by your side<br />
Always on my mind, you take what&#8217;s wrong and make it right</p>
<p>I really need you, to feel you<br />
Wrap me in your arms, surround me sweetly, completely<br />
Let me be your one and only<br />
Love me like you do, just let me give my lovin&#8217; all to you</p>
<p>Let me give my lovin&#8217; all to you</p>
