<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>From the first day I saw you to the last time we met<br />
I&#8217;ve desired to hold you, have you and make you mine</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>But to have and to hold, to love and to grow<br />
It takes two hearts that beat to the rhythm of one<br />
When you push me away I taste fear and pain<br />
Turns my fire to smoke with one word, with one stroke</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Deep in my heart is desire to love<br />
Deep in my soul is desire to grow<br />
Deep in your smile is desire for more<br />
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can&#8217;t be missed</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Let me live, let me die, let me laugh, let me cry<br />
Let me burn in your fire, in flames of desire<br />
Be my river of hope, my mountain of truth<br />
Let me colour your life with the colour of love</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Deep in my heart is desire to love<br />
Deep in my soul is desire to grow<br />
Deep in your smile is desire for more<br />
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can&#8217;t be missed</em></font></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted you, I&#8217;ve always desired you<br />
You&#8217;re the one I&#8217;ve always loved</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Take me up, take me down, take me into your arms<br />
Spin the magic of love with one word, with one smile<br />
My desire runs deep and I&#8217;m losing sleep<br />
I wake up to the light, you&#8217;re the key to my heart</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Deep in my heart is desire to love<br />
Deep in my soul is desire to grow<br />
Deep in your smile is desire for more<br />
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can&#8217;t be missed</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>(Deep in my heart is desire to love) Deep in my soul<br />
(Deep in my soul is desire to grow)<br />
Deep in your smile is desire for more<br />
Deep when we kiss, the feeling that can&#8217;t be missed</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Desire, desire, desire, desire love</em></font><br />
