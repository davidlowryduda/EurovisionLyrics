<p>With you in my life, it&#8217;s destined to be right<br />
And I know that it&#8217;s true, girl, I was only made for you<br />
So why don&#8217;t we make the pieces fit and pack our bags tonight?<br />
And go wherever love will take us, we&#8217;ll make it all right </p>
<p>Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice<br />
Tell me there is no compromise<br />
We&#8217;ll be together all the time<br />
So say you will be mine </p>
<p>Ooh, with you by my side, I&#8217;m on a roller-coaster ride<br />
And I know that it&#8217;s true, boy, I was only made for you<br />
Listen to me now, you&#8217;ve got to give me a sign<br />
&#8216;Cause I can&#8217;t wait here any longer, make up your mind </p>
<p>Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice<br />
Tell me there is no compromise<br />
We&#8217;ll be together all the time </p>
<p>Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice<br />
Tell me there is no compromise<br />
We&#8217;ll be together all the time<br />
So say you will be mine </p>
<p>If you only knew all that we could do<br />
We&#8217;d be together all alone, you and me<br />
Like we were always meant to be </p>
<p>Oh, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s fact or fiction<br />
But I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll make the right decision<br />
Look into my eyes now, baby, give it all you&#8217;ve got </p>
<p>Tell me, tell me, tell me once, tell me twice<br />
Tell me there is no compromise<br />
We&#8217;ll be together all the time </p>
<p>Tell me, tell it to me once, tell me twice<br />
Tell me there is no compromise<br />
We&#8217;ll be together all the time</p>
