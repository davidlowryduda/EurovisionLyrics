<p>My friends gonna call me: &#8220;Hey dreamer<br />
The stars you are watching are so far&#8221;<br />
Tonight, I know, I will get there<br />
By plane or by bus, right to my star</p>
<p>Pretend there are things you just don&#8217;t know<br />
In spite someone&#8217;s told you are so cute<br />
You have to ask and I will show<br />
The snow in the summer or so, so</p>
<p>If my star would fall or disappear at all<br />
I will follow my star till the end of my days<br />
And my heart&#8217;s gonna lead me through so many ways<br />
And if you&#8217;re gonna join me, I&#8217;ll be your guide<br />
Baby, never say never, be my runaway bride</p>
<p>My friends gonna tell me: &#8220;Just calm down<br />
The clouds you are walking are so high&#8221;<br />
This is my chance, and I&#8217;ll invite<br />
All the dreamers and lovers to fly, fly</p>
<p>I&#8217;m back from the future, life goes on<br />
But still, I remember my promise<br />
You have to ask and I will show<br />
The snow in the summer or so, so</p>
<p>If my star would fall or disappear at all<br />
I will follow my star till the end of my days<br />
And my heart&#8217;s gonna lead me through so many ways<br />
And if you&#8217;re gonna join me, I&#8217;ll be your guide<br />
Baby, never say never, be my runaway bride, yeah</p>
<p>My runaway bride, hey, hey, hey&#8230; hey yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>If my star would fall or disappear at all<br />
I will follow my star till the end of my days<br />
And my heart&#8217;s gonna lead me through so many ways<br />
And if you&#8217;re gonna join me, I&#8217;ll be your guide<br />
Baby, never say never, be my runaway bride</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; hey&#8230; my runaway&#8230;</p>
