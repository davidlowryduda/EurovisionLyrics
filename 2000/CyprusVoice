I lost everything when<br />
I hurt and I later cried so much<br />
Inflamed with your love<br />
I forget your honour, I burn</p>
<p>But with all that touches us<br />
So much still keeps us apart, so much<br />
Life expects us to be different<br />
And waits for it, but for how long?</p>
<p>I believed that I would find a way<br />
To bring together all that kept us apart<br />
You know that it&#8217;s bright red, and the fire within us<br />
Will never die away, it&#8217;ll cause so much trouble</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to absorb emotions for ignoring, light<br />
I&#8217;m all right the way I am and time won&#8217;t change you</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; I believed that I would find a way<br />
To bring together all that kept us apart<br />
I believed that my heart came first<br />
Yet I&#8217;m leaving, though I still love you (I love you)</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah&#8230;<br />
I believed that I would find a way<br />
I believed&#8230; I believed&#8230;<br />
Nanana&#8230; nanana&#8230; nanana&#8230; ah ah ah&#8230;</p>
<p>I believed that my heart came first<br />
Yet I&#8217;m leaving, though I still love you<br />
