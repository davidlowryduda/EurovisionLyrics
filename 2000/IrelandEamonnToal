<p>Nature&#8217;s child lays beside a mother&#8217;s broken heart<br />
We stand denied the power and glory<br />
Bitterness can&#8217;t feed the hungry, hate just leaves us cold<br />
It&#8217;s time to change it</p>
<p>I lit a candle in a dream I thought I heard<br />
Liberated voices crying freedom<br />
Open hearts, open doors in truth and honesty<br />
Let wisdom be the guiding light</p>
<p>Celebrate the new millennium of love<br />
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children<br />
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare<br />
I believe we all have the answer</p>
<p>A cloud can hide a mountain<br />
And a face can hide the pain<br />
Search until you find the answer<br />
There is no reason<br />
Who can understand man&#8217;s inhumanity to man?</p>
<p>Celebrate the new millennium of love<br />
Where our footprints leave a harvest for the children<br />
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare<br />
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe in you</p>
<p>(Celebrate the new millennium of love)<br />
Let our footprints leave a harvest for the children<br />
Somewhere on our journey lies a world beyond compare<br />
I believe we all have the answer<br />
I believe we all have the answer</p>
