<p>I am caught in a trap, there is no turning back<br />
I&#8217;m finally facin&#8217; the fear<br />
The sky is on fire, and up with the flames<br />
My hope and my dreams disappear</p>
<p>So bring me the power, I&#8217;ll be the king of the land and the seas<br />
Show me the way to go, let me fight with my body and soul</p>
<p>Let me be the native son with freedom in my heart<br />
Life will never be the same when spirits are calling my name<br />
My name&#8230;</p>
<p>Let me out of the darkness, the shadow of pain<br />
And I&#8217;m keepin&#8217; my promise to you<br />
My people, my spirit, the home of my heart<br />
You&#8217;re with me wherever I go</p>
<p>So bring me the power, I&#8217;ll be the king of the land and the seas<br />
I&#8217;ve got a way to go, let me fight with my body and soul</p>
<p>Let me be the native son with freedom in my heart<br />
Life will never be the same when spirits are calling my name<br />
My name&#8230;</p>
<p>So bring me the power, I&#8217;ll be the king of the land and the seas<br />
I&#8217;ve got a way to go, let me fight with my body and soul</p>
<p>Let me be the native son with freedom in my home<br />
Life will never be the same when spirits are calling my name<br />
Spirits are calling my name</p>
