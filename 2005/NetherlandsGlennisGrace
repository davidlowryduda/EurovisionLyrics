<p>I have a dream&#8230;</p>
<p>You &#8216;n&#8217; me, we&#8217;re driftin&#8217; far apart<br />
Our story has been told<br />
Can&#8217;t you see, the writing&#8217;s on the wall?<br />
I&#8217;ve come in from the cold<br />
And I will follow my dream</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fight the big wide world, I&#8217;ll make it on my own<br />
Against all odds I&#8217;m breakin&#8217; free<br />
The gauntlet has been thrown, my colours have been shown<br />
Now I seek my impossible dream</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s the time to hold my head up high<br />
Find my identity<br />
So I will follow my dream</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fight the big wide world, I&#8217;ll make it on my own<br />
Against all odds I&#8217;m breakin&#8217; free<br />
The gauntlet has been thrown, my colours have been shown<br />
Now I seek my impossible dream<br />
My dream&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fight the big world, I&#8217;ll make it on my own again<br />
Against all odds I&#8217;m breakin&#8217; free<br />
The gauntlet has been thrown, my colours have been shown<br />
Now I seek my impossible dream</p>
