<p>Please don&#8217;t be sad, it&#8217;s like you always dreamed<br />
I wear the white veil, oh mother, bless me please<br />
Don&#8217;t you cry, tomorrow I go<br />
The last night falling</p>
<p>Do you recall how I would imagine a white wedding dress?<br />
And now finally my time is here<br />
I know that I will miss your sweet words singing</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll cry<br />
Still I hope you will sing, sing for me</p>
<p>Ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice<br />
Ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
May the whole world shake as one</p>
<p>Let the song begin<br />
Celebrate the dance within<br />
Ti-ti-da-ti&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll cry<br />
Still I hope you will sing, sing for me</p>
<p>Ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice<br />
Ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
May the whole world shake as one</p>
<p>Let the song begin<br />
Celebrate the dance within<br />
Ti-ti-da&#8230;</p>
<p>Eh ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
Lift the drum beat, raise your voice<br />
Ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
May the whole world shake as one</p>
<p>Let the song begin<br />
Celebrate the dance within<br />
Ti-ti-da-ti&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;<br />
Ti-ti-da&#8230; eh ti-ti-da&#8230;<br />
Let the song begin<br />
Celebrate the dance within<br />
Ti-ti-da-ti&#8230;</p>
