Everyone thinks of himself<br />
As if there&#8217;s nothing but that<br />
Everyone accomplishes<br />
What he wants</p>
<p>Everyone thinks of himself<br />
As if there&#8217;s nothing but that<br />
Everyone accomplishes<br />
What he wants</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look around us<br />
We live in a world of fools<br />
Everyone looks for glory<br />
Everyone looks for hope</p>
<p>We forget what surrounds us<br />
Those who give us love<br />
We hunt away from our memory<br />
What we don&#8217;t want to believe</p>
<p>We leave behind on the side of the road<br />
Our sorrows with no day after<br />
We each follow our path</p>
<p>We each leave behind on the side of the path<br />
All our little doubts<br />
We follow our road</p>
<p>Everyone thinks of himself<br />
As if there&#8217;s nothing but that<br />
Everyone accomplishes<br />
What he wants</p>
<p>Everyone thinks of himself<br />
As if there&#8217;s nothing but that<br />
Everyone accomplishes<br />
What he wants</p>
<p>We hold in the palm of our hands<br />
The keys to our destiny<br />
To lead to victory<br />
All our dreams of one night</p>
<p>And we run behind the time<br />
We pass beside people<br />
We run for money<br />
We hide ourselves, we lie</p>
<p>Even if the solitude<br />
Is our only attitude<br />
We hold within each of us</p>
<p>The love of those who love us<br />
Even if we are in pain<br />
We will find each other</p>
<p>Even if the reality<br />
Is not our truth<br />
We keep believing in it<br />
In this fighting for our history</p>
<p>Even if the price to pay<br />
Is higher with each time<br />
We keep believing in it<br />
Hopes for our hopes</p>
<p>Everyone thinks of himself<br />
As if there&#8217;s nothing but that<br />
Everyone accomplishes<br />
What he wants</p>
