<p>You&#8217;d better run and hide</p>
<p>Twenty five dollars wasted on you<br />
Got you out of trouble, but you&#8217;ll soon<br />
Come by for another try</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a friend of mine and I know<br />
Only crooked places you can go<br />
Your eyes conveyed too many lies</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better run and hide<br />
Too many girls have cried<br />
Oh no, no, no, why<br />
Do I feel sorry?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better run and hide<br />
Too many dreams have died<br />
Oh no, no, no, why<br />
Do I still worry?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better run and<br />
You&#8217;d better run and hide</p>
<p>Twenty five reasons to leave you<br />
But I&#8217;m still feeling kinda blue inside<br />
Watching our worlds collide</p>
<p>Baby, gotta see you as you are<br />
Wipe the rest of yearning out of my heart<br />
And try to say that last goodbye<br />
Yeah, yeah, yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better run and hide<br />
Too many girls have cried<br />
Oh no, no, no, why<br />
Do I feel sorry?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better run and hide<br />
Too many dreams have died<br />
Oh no, no, no, why<br />
Do I still worry?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah&#8230;<br />
No, no, no, no<br />
I still worry</p>
<p>You&#8217;d better run and hide, hide<br />
You&#8217;d better run and hide<br />
You&#8217;d better run and hide</p>
