<p>You nailed me to the floor with just one look<br />
I&#8217;ll sail any ocean to show my devotion<br />
If only I could open up your eyes<br />
And get your attention, a brand new dimension</p>
<p>Connect your inner line<br />
And tell me that you&#8217;re mine<br />
Mm-mmh, yeah</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking to you through my heart<br />
Talking to you girl, just tell me where to start<br />
I wanna get through right away<br />
Wanna get through now, can&#8217;t wait another day</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all I hoped to find<br />
I&#8217;ve never felt like this before<br />
I got to make you mine</p>
<p>I wonder how it feels to be with you<br />
Imagination, my sweet temptation<br />
I just can&#8217;t get enough<br />
I&#8217;m desperate, desperate for your love</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking to you through my heart<br />
Talking to you girl, just tell me where to start<br />
I wanna get through right away<br />
Wanna get through now, can&#8217;t wait another day</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all I hoped to find<br />
I&#8217;ve never felt like this before<br />
I&#8217;ve got to make you mine</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m talking to, I&#8217;m talking to you)<br />
I&#8217;m talking to you, baby<br />
(I wanna get, I wanna get through)<br />
I wanna get through</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m talking to you through my heart)<br />
Talking to you girl, just tell me where to start<br />
(I wanna get through right away)<br />
Wanna get through (Wanna get through now)<br />
Can&#8217;t wait another day</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all I hoped to find<br />
I&#8217;ve never felt like this before<br />
I know you will be mine</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking to you</p>
