Spin, world<br />
Carry me into the light or I won&#8217;t live tomorrow<br />
Your wild night kills me<br />
Although it is waiting for me with a kiss</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hurt me, world<br />
Don&#8217;t hug, don&#8217;t feel, your love hurts more<br />
Don&#8217;t play, world<br />
Let me go if a happy land calls</p>
<p>Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
I want to be somewhere else for a long time<br />
Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
I don&#8217;t see any light, I won&#8217;t wait for it</p>
<p>Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
I disappear in the sky or on the ground somewhere<br />
Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
That&#8217;s how every sorrow can turn into a dream</p>
<p>Spin, world<br />
I&#8217;m cold in the dark, you are at the end of all hope<br />
Crazy world<br />
You flame up, but turn into ice</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hurt me, world<br />
I&#8217;m not walking on your path, don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t call, don&#8217;t see me<br />
Don&#8217;t regret it, world<br />
All the other hearts are yours</p>
<p>Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
I want to be somewhere else for a long time<br />
Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
I don&#8217;t see any light, I won&#8217;t wait for it</p>
<p>Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
I disappear in the sky or on the ground somewhere<br />
Haynana nanana&#8230; haynana nanana&#8230;<br />
That&#8217;s how every sorrow can turn into a dream<br />
