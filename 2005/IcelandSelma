<p>If I had your love<br />
You would be what most inspires me<br />
Sacred soul, fantasy, brightest light<br />
Guiding me on wings</p>
<p>You would be the heart inside me<br />
What I&#8217;d wish on a star<br />
All to me, that is what you are</p>
<p>If I had your love I could live my dream<br />
Flying high above everything<br />
If I had your love you would light my world<br />
That would be enough if I had your love</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; if I held you close<br />
Feeling your heart beat beside me<br />
Fast asleep, wide awake<br />
Every step, every move I make</p>
<p>If I had your love I could live my dream<br />
Flying high above everything<br />
If I had your love you would light my world<br />
That would be enough if I had your love</p>
<p>If I had your love I&#8217;d live out my dream<br />
Flying high above, oh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>If I had your love I could live my dream<br />
Flying high above everything<br />
If I had your love you would light my world<br />
That would be enough if I had your love</p>
