I rest on a dusty wall<br />
With all might, I resist it<br />
I knock and hope that you don&#8217;t hear me<br />
You open the door, as if you don&#8217;t care</p>
<p>Why are we both pretending?<br />
You&#8217;ve been marked by his kiss</p>
<p>Bind my hands so I can drown<br />
In your embrace, because of lies, I bleed out<br />
Tell me to stop when I look you in your eyes<br />
At least tonight</p>
<p>Bind my hands so I can drown<br />
In your embrace, because of lies, I bleed out<br />
Tell me to stop when I look you in your eyes<br />
Protect me at least tonight</p>
<p>For so long you&#8217;ve been hiding with kisses in your hands<br />
With a heavy heart you doubt us<br />
Brush me off like dust, destroy everything through your fingers<br />
So I don&#8217;t fall because of hope</p>
<p>Bind my hands so I can drown<br />
In your embrace, because of lies, I bleed out<br />
Tell me to stop when I look you in your eyes<br />
Protect me at least tonight, protect me</p>
<p>Lalala laila&#8230;<br />
Lalala laila laila&#8230;<br />
