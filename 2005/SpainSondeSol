In every corner of my home, in every thing that happens to me<br />
I feel his presence looking at me<br />
I look in every corner, I search in every drawer<br />
Messing up everything until I find my soul</p>
<p>And I surrender to him, and I don&#8217;t know what to do<br />
Love dominates me</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to go out, I don&#8217;t want to eat<br />
I don&#8217;t want to live another adventure<br />
I get hot with your body, I feed myself with your kisses<br />
Because you are my only madness</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know what to do, I believe<br />
That it is witchcraft</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no cure for my soul<br />
I only desire your warm body<br />
And you look like a burning fire<br />
That penetrates me all, all<br />
And I become the target of your witchcraft</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no cure for my soul<br />
You dominate me with only one look<br />
And you don&#8217;t need ropes to tie me up<br />
I&#8217;m a beast that doesn&#8217;t escape for love<br />
Although you open the grills</p>
<p>(Le le ley le, le le le ley le)<br />
(Le le le ley le, ley)</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t antidotes nor ointments, neither cures from the past<br />
That can take this obsession out of my head<br />
There&#8217;s neither a fantastic owl, nor wings of a muse<br />
Even if they&#8217;re cooked with melons and cherries</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know what to do, I believe<br />
That it is witchcraft</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no cure for my soul<br />
I only desire your warm body<br />
And you look like a burning fire<br />
That penetrates me all, all<br />
And I become the target of your witchcraft</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no cure for my soul<br />
You dominate me with only one look<br />
And you don&#8217;t need ropes to tie me up<br />
I&#8217;m a beast that doesn&#8217;t escape for love<br />
Although you open the grills</p>
<p>(Blend some happiness)<br />
(With a little fantasy and your lover will answer)<br />
(I would like you to wrap me)<br />
(With your bullfighter&#8217;s cloak, and only this way I&#8217;d like)<br />
(Your love, your love, your love)</p>
<p>Witchcraft, there&#8217;s no cure for my soul<br />
I only desire your warm body<br />
And you look like a burning fire<br />
That penentrates me all, all<br />
And I become the target of your witchcraft</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no cure for my soul<br />
You dominate me with only one look<br />
And you don&#8217;t need ropes to tie me up<br />
I&#8217;m a beast that doesn&#8217;t escape for love<br />
Although you open the grills</p>
<p>Witchcraft<br />
