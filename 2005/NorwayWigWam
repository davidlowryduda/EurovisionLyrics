<p>Come on, come on, come on<br />
Love is all over me (Over me)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is what it seems<br />
Is it real or just a fantasy?<br />
Aim to please is all you every do<br />
Making all my fairytales come true</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on<br />
Love is all over me (Over me)<br />
You are the only one<br />
Livin&#8217; in my fantasy, in my dreams</p>
<p>Scared of waking up and you&#8217;ll be gone<br />
Face the truth and I&#8217;ll be all alone<br />
Baby, let&#8217;s get into the groove<br />
Show me all your dirty moves</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on<br />
Love is all over me (Over me)<br />
You are the only one<br />
Livin&#8217; in my fantasy, in my dreams</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on<br />
Love is all over me (Over me)<br />
You are the only one<br />
Livin&#8217; in my fantasy, in my dreams<br />
In my dreams</p>
<p>If this ain&#8217;t real, don&#8217;t wake me up<br />
I don&#8217;t ever wanna stop<br />
No, no</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on<br />
Love is all over me<br />
You are the only one<br />
Livin&#8217; in my fantasy, in my dreams</p>
<p>Come on, come on, come on<br />
Love is all over me<br />
You are the only one<br />
Livin&#8217; in my fantasy, in my dreams</p>
<p>(Come on, come on, come on)<br />
(Love is all over me) Ooh&#8230;<br />
(You are the only one)<br />
(Livin&#8217; in my fantasy)<br />
In my dreams</p>
