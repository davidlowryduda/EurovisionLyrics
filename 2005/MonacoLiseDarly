I&#8217;d give the dearest I have<br />
I could even say some prayers<br />
I&#8217;d learn to become the one<br />
You want me to become</p>
<p>I&#8217;d face storms and winds<br />
I&#8217;d shout out my feelings clearly out loud<br />
To fuse our routes<br />
I&#8217;d become your angel</p>
<p>All of me<br />
I lay my time and my weapons down at your feet<br />
When everything already<br />
Reminds me that I&#8217;m nothing without you</p>
<p>Yes, all of me<br />
I give you all my dreams, my heart and my soul<br />
When everything already<br />
Reminds me that I don&#8217;t exist without you</p>
<p>In this town where everything speaks about us<br />
The memory of our dates are left<br />
I hang up words full of hope<br />
Waiting for the evening wind</p>
<p>I have nights that look like years<br />
I&#8217;ve lost sleep by dreaming too much<br />
I&#8217;ve shouted against walls<br />
But nothing puts my mind at ease</p>
<p>All of me<br />
I lay my time and my weapons down at your feet<br />
When everything already<br />
Reminds me that I&#8217;m nothing without you</p>
<p>And if the gods are against us<br />
Then I would be a marabout<br />
I would hunt cold winters<br />
Like a queen of hearts defends her king<br />
Oh whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>All of me<br />
I lay my time and my weapons down at your feet<br />
When everything already<br />
Reminds me that I&#8217;m nothing without you<br />
