<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Silence ties the dark like an anchor<br />
The fear in me slowly melts away<br />
This love was a vision<br />
This is not my time</p>
<p>Only a few hours left till dawn<br />
And outside unrest, as if a war is on<br />
I put my coat on and leave<br />
To forget everything</p>
<p>And once again boats sail down the Danube<br />
Don&#8217;t you worry about me anymore<br />
I&#8217;m like leaves, the wind blows me away<br />
Wolves die alone</p>
<p>And once again boats sail down the Danube<br />
Don&#8217;t you worry about me anymore<br />
I&#8217;m like leaves, the wind blows me away<br />
Wolves die alone</p>
<p>Silence ties the dark like an anchor<br />
The fear in me slowly melts away<br />
I put my coat on and leave<br />
To forget everything</p>
<p>And once again boats sail down the Danube<br />
Don&#8217;t you worry about me anymore<br />
I&#8217;m like leaves, the wind blows me away<br />
Wolves die alone</p>
<p>(Down the Danube, down the Danube)<br />
(Down the Danube, down the Danube)<br />
(Down the Danube, down the Danube)<br />
(Down the Danube)</p>
<p>And once again (boats sail down the Danube)<br />
Don&#8217;t you worry about me anymore<br />
I&#8217;m like leaves, the wind blows me away<br />
Wolves die alone</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like leaves, the wind blows me away<br />
Wolves die alone</p>
<p>(Down the Danube)<br />
