<p>Standing here alone again<br />
Waiting for the moment that we&#8217;ve shared, my love<br />
No matter how many lies you say<br />
No matter how many miles you walk away from me, Lorraine</p>
<p>Here I am, all alone, waiting for the moment again<br />
But I know that you&#8217;re gone</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to know that harder the rain, sweeter the pain<br />
I can still remember, Lorraine, in the rain<br />
Calling you, again and again, I&#8217;ll wait for your name<br />
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain</p>
<p>Whispering your name again, saying prayers<br />
Among the stars, for you, my sweet Lorraine<br />
You&#8217;ve always given me some great time<br />
Try to imagine how we fly so far away from here, my love</p>
<p>Here I am, all alone, waiting for the moment we&#8217;ve shared<br />
But I know that you&#8217;re gone</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to know that harder the rain, sweeter the pain<br />
I can still remember, Lorraine, in the rain<br />
Calling you, again and again, I&#8217;ll wait for your name<br />
I can still remember Lorraine in the rain</p>
