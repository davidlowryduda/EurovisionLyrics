<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Tonight, all these looks, there in the dark, fear and hope<br />
Tonight, it&#8217;s not too late to believe in dreams of glory<br />
Tonight, a light, in a flash, to change history<br />
Tonight, I prayed for it, I waited for it, the big night</p>
<p>Tonight, short of breath, with high commitment, not to disappoint<br />
Tonight, to change sidewalk, tonight, a new start<br />
And to see his entire life, all his friends in a glance<br />
Tonight, I make a wish I want for them, the big night</p>
<p>Tonight, we all forget the bad paths, the misty nights<br />
Tonight, it&#8217;s another day, tonight, it&#8217;s my turn at last<br />
To have, as a Sunday, a revenge and the power<br />
Tonight, to call it, to sing it, the big night, oh&#8230;<br />
The big night<br />
