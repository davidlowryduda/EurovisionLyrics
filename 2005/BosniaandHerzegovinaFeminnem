<p>Call me</p>
<p>I used to think that we could never make it<br />
That million hearts could never beat as one<br />
But now &#8211; miracle is not so hard to find</p>
<p>There were times when I really doubted<br />
If, after stormy weather, always comes the sun<br />
But now &#8211; I can see the world from a different side, yeah</p>
<p>Singer after singer, remembered<br />
Different flags, but nations gathered<br />
From the north to the south, all standing side by side</p>
<p>There was laughter and there was crying<br />
But after all, I&#8217;m not denying<br />
I&#8217;m so happy to be here, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s the time of my life</p>
<p>Call me<br />
Every time you&#8217;re feeling lonely<br />
Our greatest wish is one and only<br />
Sing with me, it&#8217;s how it should be<br />
For the rest of our lives </p>
<p>So won&#8217;t you call me?<br />
We&#8217;ll reach the very top and nothing less<br />
United in the song, that&#8217;s all it takes<br />
Fifty candles on the party cake<br />
For many years of happiness </p>
