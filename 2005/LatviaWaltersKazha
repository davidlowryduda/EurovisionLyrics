<p>Ta na na na&#8230; na na&#8230;<br />
Na na na&#8230; na na&#8230;</p>
<p>I slowly walk into the night around<br />
To see how dreams of people die<br />
They gently fall from windows all around<br />
And crash against the ground like glass</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m so sorry I&#8217;m so helpless in this angry world<br />
If only I could change it for one day</p>
<p>The war is not over, everyone knows it<br />
It&#8217;s just a reason to make us believe<br />
That someone&#8217;s the loser, someone&#8217;s the winner<br />
To make us believe that&#8217;s the way it should be<br />
But I don&#8217;t wanna believe</p>
<p>In the story they all tell<br />
This fairy tale has gone too far<br />
I take a step and dare myself to be free<br />
To see how beautiful we are<br />
That everyone can be a star</p>
<p>If only we would start believe in dreams<br />
Believe in who we are</p>
<p>The war is not over, everyone knows it<br />
It&#8217;s just a reason to make us believe<br />
That someone&#8217;s the loser, someone&#8217;s the winner<br />
To make us believe that&#8217;s the way it should be<br />
But I don&#8217;t wanna believe</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t wanna believe<br />
No no no, but I don&#8217;t wanna believe</p>
