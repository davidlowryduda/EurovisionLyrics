<p>I was blind to the light of day<br />
From all the logic there was no room left<br />
Trembling beside you and the drug in me is not yet finished<br />
I&#8217;m breathing you and the taste is already bitter</p>
<p>The glance is different and the cold is piercing<br />
You&#8217;re hiding, breaking my body<br />
The glance is different and the cold is piercing<br />
How another day goes by without a breath</p>
<p>Nighttime comes slowly, time stands still<br />
Nighttime and you are the silence that remains<br />
Falling with you for one moment at the end of the game<br />
(And only the silence that remains)</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>With dozen lonely nights in my empty bed<br />
Waiting for your touch, drying tears instead<br />
I can&#8217;t forget them, promises you made had no faith<br />
You never really kept them and now it&#8217;s goodbye</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Oh, now that love is gone where do I belong?<br />
Was it right or wrong? Look at me now</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Finally I know it&#8217;s time to say goodbye<br />
Suddenly all by myself I feel alive<br />
I can&#8217;t live the lie, no reason to cry<br />
But now it&#8217;s just time, ooh&#8230;<br />
(It&#8217;s time to say goodbye)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Finally tonight (I know) I feel alive<br />
Can&#8217;t live the lie, no reason to cry<br />
But now it&#8217;s just time, oh&#8230;</em></font><br />
(And only the silence that remains)<br />
