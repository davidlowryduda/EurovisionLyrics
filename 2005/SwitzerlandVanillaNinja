<p>Don&#8217;t want you to lead me to the dark<br />
Don&#8217;t need you to tear my heart apart<br />
Don&#8217;t do that, though people say that you&#8217;re my enemy<br />
I know you can set me free (Oh oh&#8230;)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t want you to come so close to me<br />
Don&#8217;t need you to blow my fantasy<br />
But I know that you are livin&#8217; far beyond those lies<br />
I can see the danger rise in your eyes</p>
<p>Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you kill me?<br />
Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you turn your eyes away?<br />
Can&#8217;t you see we&#8217;re free to die?<br />
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray</p>
<p>Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you thrill me? (Cool vibes)<br />
Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you kill me?<br />
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny (Oh oh&#8230;)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t want you to make me feel afraid<br />
Don&#8217;t need you to take away the hate<br />
But I know that you will break the seal of mystery<br />
Leave it to my fantasy, what will be?</p>
<p>Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you kill me?<br />
Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you turn your eyes away?<br />
Can&#8217;t you see we&#8217;re free to die?<br />
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray (Oh oh&#8230;)</p>
<p>Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you thrill me? (Cool vibes)<br />
Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you kill me?<br />
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny</p>
<p>Stay close to me, infinity<br />
Enigma&#8217;s what we share, but I don&#8217;t care<br />
You&#8217;ll be there</p>
<p>Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you kill me? (Cool vibes)<br />
Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you turn your eyes away?<br />
Can&#8217;t you see we&#8217;re free to die?<br />
Cool vibes, all we can do is fight and pray<br />
(For some broken heroes)</p>
<p>Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you thrill me? (Cool vibes)<br />
Cool vibes, why don&#8217;t you kill me? (Cool vibes)<br />
All that I can see are shadows of my destiny</p>
