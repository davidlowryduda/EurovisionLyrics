<p>Love can build you up, love can tear you down<br />
Love can change the world, this is what I&#8217;ve found<br />
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry<br />
Love can be the best until it&#8217;s passed you by<br />
(Love, love, love)</p>
<p>Do you wanna, do you wanna, do you wanna fall in love?<br />
Do you need it? Can you feel it? Do you think you&#8217;re strong enough?<br />
Can you take the highs? Can you take the lows?<br />
Can you handle everything love throws?</p>
<p>Love can build you up, love can tear you down<br />
Love can change the world, this is what I&#8217;ve found<br />
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry<br />
Love can be the best until it&#8217;s passed you by<br />
(Love, love, love)</p>
<p>If you want it, come and get it, even though you know the score<br />
I will love you, I will hate you, then I&#8217;ll love you even more<br />
Can you handle love? Can you handle pain?<br />
Can you handle everything I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;?</p>
<p>Love can build you up, love can tear you down<br />
Love can change the world, this is what I&#8217;ve found<br />
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry<br />
Love can be the best until it&#8217;s passed you by<br />
(Love, love, love)</p>
<p>Love will capture you whole with your body and soul<br />
Love is taking control of your senses<br />
Love is guilty as tried, love has no alibi<br />
Love is breaking down all your defences<br />
Love</p>
<p>Love can make you sorry, love can make you weep<br />
Love can take you over even when you sleep<br />
Love can give you heaven, love can make you high<br />
Love can make you cheat and love can make you lie</p>
<p>Love can build you up, love can tear you down<br />
Love can change the world, this is what I&#8217;ve found<br />
Love can make you happy, love can make you cry<br />
Love can be the best until it&#8217;s passed you by</p>
