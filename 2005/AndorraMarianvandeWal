There you will see a strength which makes<br />
Everything stay where it is</p>
<p>Irradiate peace, irradiate light<br />
Irradiate harmony, be yourself</p>

Bathe in the calmness of the clear water<br />
Where you will find the essence of the one you want to be</p>
<p>Look within</p>

The beauty of life<br />

Through the inner look</p>
