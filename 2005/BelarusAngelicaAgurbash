<p>I wish you could be near me<br />
I seek your eyes to thrill me<br />
So take your chance and feel me<br />
I am ready now</p>
<p>(I dream of you by my side) Move closer, baby<br />
(You&#8217;ve got a place in my mind) I&#8217;m with you, baby<br />
(Do it to me one more time) I&#8217;m waiting, baby<br />
Give me the time of my life</p>
<p>Love me tonight and I&#8217;ll love you forever<br />
It&#8217;s no sin, it&#8217;s no crime that I want you mine<br />
Love me tonight, I need you more than ever<br />
You can make me feel right, just love me tonight<br />
Love me tonight</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got no hesitation<br />
It&#8217;s my infatuation<br />
Your touch is an obsession<br />
I&#8217;m addicted now</p>
<p>(I dream of you by my side) Move closer, baby<br />
(You&#8217;ve got a place in my mind) I&#8217;m with you, baby<br />
(Do it to me one more time) I&#8217;m waiting, baby<br />
Give me the time of my life</p>
<p>Love me tonight, I need you more than ever<br />
You can make me feel right, just love me tonight</p>
<p>(Do it to me one more time)<br />
(Give me the time of my life)<br />
(Give me the time of my life)</p>
<p>Love me tonight, I need you more than ever<br />
You can make me feel right, just love me tonight<br />
Love me tonight, love me tonight</p>
<p>Love you forever and we&#8217;ll be together<br />
So just stay with me for the night<br />
Love me tonight</p>
