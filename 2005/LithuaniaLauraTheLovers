<p>Night shadows falling<br />
I hear you calling<br />
We&#8217;re finally talking<br />
Your words touch my soul</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken a long time<br />
To get inside your mind<br />
I know it&#8217;s not easy<br />
But baby, we&#8217;re two of a kind</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; little by little<br />
I&#8217;m getting close to your heart<br />
When we&#8217;re together<br />
Looks like we&#8217;re making a start</p>
<p>Little by little<br />
I see that look in your eyes<br />
Each time you touch me<br />
I want to reach out for you</p>
<p>No more confusion<br />
It ain&#8217;t no illusion<br />
This is a fusion<br />
Of body and mind</p>
<p>We&#8217;re meant for each other<br />
So baby, come on, hold me tight<br />
We&#8217;ll make it together<br />
As we fly into the night</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; little by little<br />
I&#8217;m getting close to your heart<br />
When we&#8217;re together<br />
Looks like we&#8217;re making a start</p>
<p>Little by little<br />
I see that look in your eyes<br />
Each time you touch me<br />
I want to reach out for you</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; little by little</p>
<p>Little by little<br />
I&#8217;m getting close to your heart<br />
When we&#8217;re together<br />
Looks like we&#8217;re making a start</p>
<p>Little by little<br />
I see that look in your eyes<br />
Each time you touch me<br />
I want to reach out for you</p>
