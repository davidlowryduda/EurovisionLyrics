<p>In the night, there&#8217;s a candle burning<br />
Little light full of ache and yearning<br />
For the child who won&#8217;t be returning<br />
And all the loved ones left behind</p>
<p>Morning breaks with the news of violence<br />
Nothing moves in the haze of silence<br />
Deep inside it feels like a riot<br />
Oh, where can I find peace of mind?</p>
<p>(And they say that our trouble&#8217;s just begun)<br />
Tell me how<br />
(Tell me how much we&#8217;ll lose before we&#8217;ve won)<br />
These tears won&#8217;t dry</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m asking<br />
Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
Will we ever find the answer?<br />
Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
Why can&#8217;t love be all that matters?</p>
<p>Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
While we try to understand<br />
Faith and hope are slipping through our hands<br />
Can you tell me why?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the secret to make things better?<br />
Where&#8217;s the thread holding us together?<br />
How do we find the key that lets us<br />
Open up our hearts and minds?</p>
<p>Winds of faith blow us past our limits<br />
Spend our lives searching for forgiveness<br />
Can one voice really make a difference?<br />
Still I know we&#8217;ve got to try</p>
<p>(And they say that our trouble&#8217;s just begun)<br />
Tell me how<br />
(Tell me how much we&#8217;ll lose before we&#8217;ve won)<br />
These tears won&#8217;t dry</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m asking<br />
Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
Will we ever find the answer?<br />
Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
Why can&#8217;t love be all that matters?</p>
<p>Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
While we try to understand<br />
That faith and hope are slipping through our hands<br />
(Tell me why)</p>
<p>Tears are falling down like rain<br />
A flood of questions come<br />
It is getting hard to wait<br />
Is really love so hard to find?</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m asking<br />
(Why?) Why&#8230;?<br />
Will we ever find the answer?<br />
Why? (Why?) Why? (Why?)<br />
Why can&#8217;t love be all that matters?</p>
<p>Why? (Why?) Why?<br />
While we pray to understand<br />
Faith and hope are slipping through our hands<br />
Tell me why</p>
