<p>When I find you in my dreams<br />
You always try to run away<br />
It doesn&#8217;t look it, but it seems<br />
You still take my breath away</p>
<p>And when I try to ask you why<br />
We couldn&#8217;t give it one more try<br />
I can&#8217;t find you anywhere<br />
You are not there</p>
<p>Let me try, let me try<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna say goodbye<br />
I will find a way to make you stay<br />
Just let me try</p>
<p>Looking back, I realise<br />
We are learning from mistakes<br />
I can see it in your eyes<br />
I can feel your heartbeat breaks</p>
<p>But when I try to ask you why<br />
We couldn&#8217;t give it one more try<br />
I can&#8217;t find you anywhere<br />
You are not there</p>
<p>Let me try, let me try<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna say goodbye<br />
I will find a way to make you stay<br />
Just let me try</p>
<p>Let me try, let me try<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna say goodbye<br />
I will find a way to make you stay<br />
Just let me try</p>
<p>Let me try, let me try<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna say goodbye<br />
I will find a way to make you stay<br />
Just let me try</p>
<p>Let me try<br />
I will find a way to make you stay<br />
Just let me try</p>
