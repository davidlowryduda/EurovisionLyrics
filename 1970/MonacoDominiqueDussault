A low and nostalgic voice<br />
In my heart sings music<br />
Old-fashioned music</p>
<p>With that, I always return<br />
To the time of the seventy-eight record<br />
Scratched and forgotten</p>
<p>It was you who charmed, Marlene<br />
Who overwhelmed, Marlene, it was you<br />
You weren&#8217;t the queen of the screen to me, Marlene<br />
But the Blue Angel that will never be forgotten</p>
<p>Long fingers, a lit cigarette<br />
A glance that never ended<br />
Doesn&#8217;t know, doesn&#8217;t know its end</p>
<p>Its black end in Cinerama<br />
A silhouette in sexyrama, Marlene<br />
Yes, it&#8217;s you</p>
<p>You smile and I&#8217;m Marlene<br />
People shout: &#8220;Marlene!&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s for me<br />
I dream of a stairway on the scene like you, Marl√®ne<br />
That I descend languorously</p>
<p>One metre fifty with my heels<br />
Curly hair like a sheep, oh, what a disillusion<br />
I wanted to resemble her so much<br />
To bewitch you, to &#8216;Marlenise&#8217; you<br />
The Blue Angel, for me it failed</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;Love, that&#8217;s my life&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m only fond of that&#8221;<br />
No, no, I can&#8217;t</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>&#8220;You take me, take me in the sky&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You make me crazy in my mind&#8221;</em></font><br />
I could never&#8230;</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>&#8220;I want you, I love you, darling&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you&#8221;</em></font><br />
I could never, never sing like that<br />
