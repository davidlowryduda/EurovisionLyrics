I lived well up there in my clouds<br />
My heart and my head were travelling<br />
I felt I was quiet for a long time<br />
For a long time</p>
<p>Everytime I looked at the earth<br />
I found it very round and very hard<br />
I didn&#8217;t want to see people<br />
But suddenly, one day, while seeing you</p>
<p>I fell from heaven to bend me over you<br />
Arriving from heaven, I fell on you<br />
Approaching you, gave me wings<br />
I fell from heaven and I&#8217;m mad with joy</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never go back to the clouds<br />
You&#8217;re my city and you&#8217;re my village<br />
I&#8217;ve discovered that the only paradise<br />
Is here</p>
<p>I pray that they will be bored when they sore up there<br />
To live alone like a sad stay-at-home<br />
When it&#8217;s enough to dive in your eyes<br />
To navigate in the middle of the blue sky</p>
<p>I fell from heaven to bend me over you<br />
Arriving from heaven, I fell on you<br />
Approaching you, gave me wings<br />
I fell from heaven and I&#8217;m mad with joy</p>
<p>Lala lala lala&#8230; lala lala lala&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lala&#8230; and I am mad with joy<br />
