<p>Snowdrops and daffodils, butterflies and bees<br />
Sailboats and fishermen, things of the sea<br />
Wishing wells, wedding bells, early morning dew<br />
All kinds of everything remind me of you</p>
<p>Seagulls and aeroplanes, things of the sky<br />
Winds that go howling, breezes that sigh<br />
City sights, neon lights, grey skies or blue<br />
All kinds of everything remind me of you</p>
<p>Summertime, wintertime<br />
Spring and autumn too<br />
Monday, Tuesday, every day<br />
I think of you</p>
<p>Dances, romances, things of the night<br />
Sunshine and holidays, postcards to write<br />
Budding trees, autumn leaves, a snowflake or two<br />
All kinds of everything remind me of you</p>
<p>Summertime, wintertime<br />
Spring and autumn too<br />
Seasons will never change<br />
The way that I love you</p>
<p>Dances, romances, things of the night<br />
Sunshine and holidays, postcards to write<br />
Budding trees, autumn leaves, a snowflake or two<br />
All kinds of everything remind me of you<br />
All kinds of everything remind me of you</p>
