Aquarius, are you an Aquarius?<br />
Then your sign of the zodiac matches mine<br />
Intuitively, I already love you<br />
It&#8217;s just like you simply belong to me</p>
<p>Aquarius, my sign and talisman<br />
From now on you belong to me<br />
Aquarius, gentle Waterman<br />
My dearest man, that&#8217;s what you are</p>
<p>Sign of the zodiac, that doesn&#8217;t play with hearts<br />
But that wants to help people, always<br />
You just don&#8217;t know a rough dominant tone<br />
You always look for warm humanity</p>
<p>Aquarius, my sign and talisman<br />
From now on you belong to me<br />
Aquarius, gentle Waterman<br />
My dearest man, that&#8217;s what you are</p>
<p>Aquarius, my sign and talisman<br />
From now on you belong to me<br />
Aquarius, gentle Waterman<br />
My dearest man, that&#8217;s what you are</p>
<p>You are always fair<br />
Always faithful and solidary<br />
But also often so credulous<br />
And somewhat deaf to evil</p>
<p>Sometimes so serious, almost shy<br />
But endlessly affectionate<br />
Aquarius<br />
