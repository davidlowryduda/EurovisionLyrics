<p>Tears of rain run down my window pane<br />
I&#8217;m on my own again, good evening, sorrow<br />
Sit and dream of how things might have been<br />
And as I close my eyes, I get the strangest feeling</p>
<p>Knock, knock, who&#8217;s there?<br />
Could this be love that&#8217;s calling?<br />
The door is always open wide</p>
<p>Knock, knock, who&#8217;s there?<br />
Now as the night is falling<br />
Take off your coat and come inside</p>
<p>Climb the stair and then I say a prayer<br />
For someone who could share my situation<br />
But instead as I lay down my head<br />
I have to leave it all to my imagination</p>
<p>Knock, knock, who&#8217;s there?<br />
Could this be love that&#8217;s calling?<br />
The door is always open wide</p>
<p>Knock, knock, who&#8217;s there?<br />
Now as the night is falling<br />
Take off your coat and come inside</p>
<p>La lala lalala la lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala la lala lalala lala&#8230;<br />
La lala lalala la lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala la lala lalala lala&#8230;</p>
<p>Sit and dream of how things might have been<br />
And as I close my eyes, I get the strangest feeling</p>
<p>Knock, knock, who&#8217;s there?<br />
Could this be love that&#8217;s calling?<br />
The door is always open wide</p>
<p>Knock, knock, who&#8217;s there?<br />
Now as the night is falling<br />
Take off your coat and come inside</p>
<p>Take off your coat and come inside</p>
