So deep inside of me I keep the warmth<br />
Which you make me feel, I keep your love<br />
So deep inside of me that I can still live<br />
Dying for love, dying for you</p>
<p>Like the waves that searches the sea shore<br />
Like the sailor that searches his harbour and his home<br />
I have searched in my soul, willing to find you<br />
And I only found my loneliness</p>
<p>And although you&#8217;re far away, so far away from me<br />
Although other kisses, maybe, Gwendolyne<br />
You still remember the time of our love<br />
You still remember me</p>
<p>And I still remember that yesterday<br />
When you were by my side, you were talking about love<br />
I could still smile, I still remember that love<br />
And now you go away from me</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked the silence to talk to me about you<br />
I&#8217;ve wandered in the night, wanting to hear you<br />
And I heard the whisper of the wind say<br />
Your name, Gwendolyne<br />
