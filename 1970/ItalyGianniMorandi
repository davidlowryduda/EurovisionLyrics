Girl&#8217;s eyes, so many skies, so many seas wait for me<br />
Girl&#8217;s eyes, if I look at them, I see the dreams I&#8217;ll make<br />
We&#8217;ll travel together to an unknown city<br />
So many springs will come, they&#8217;ll make us feel so happy<br />
They&#8217;re already in your eyes</p>
<p>Girl&#8217;s eyes, I speak to them with the silence of love<br />
And I dare to do so many things that my mouth won&#8217;t say<br />
When you wake up in the morning, all the sun is in your eyes<br />
When it gets dark, in the night your eyes<br />
Are a light that take me to you</p>
<p>One day, I will discover in them<br />
What you will hide</p>
<p>Girl&#8217;s eyes, this journey will finish sooner or later<br />
An empty shore without the sea, I should see in you<br />
Girl&#8217;s eyes, I&#8217;m going to apologize for so many things<br />
The water of a goodbye-tear will be the last present<br />
That I&#8217;ll receive from you</p>
<p>The water of a goodbye-tear will be the last present<br />
That I&#8217;ll receive from you<br />
