It&#8217;s the time that the frosty pearls settle<br />
That every leaf thinks to be a rose<br />
Somewhere a bird sings something<br />
And Marie-Blanche is mine</p>
<p>We&#8217;re there in a soft stillness<br />
We&#8217;ve put an end to our loneliness<br />
Our bodies learn tender habits<br />
And Marie-Blanche is mine</p>
<p>And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her<br />
And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me</p>
<p>The snow falls and the wind escorts her<br />
Every pond is frozen, yes, but what does it matter<br />
In the winter we closed our door<br />
And Marie-Blanche is mine</p>
<p>And Marie-Blanche is mine, and I love her<br />
And Marie-Blanche falls asleep near me</p>
<p>Oh, may the time turn its pages<br />
We&#8217;ll stay there for a century or longer<br />
The city sleeps under the wing of white clouds<br />
And Marie-Blanche is mine</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to know a thing about the rest of the world<br />
The earth never seemed so round to me<br />
Against my heart, there&#8217;s her blonde hair<br />
And Marie-Blanche is mine<br />
