<p>When the day becomes the night, you know that I think of you<br />
And I cannot control my heart, it&#8217;s crying for you<br />
Loneliness is killing me, I&#8217;m helpless without your love<br />
Knowing when you touch someone, I can&#8217;t understand</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s tearing me apart, I want you back<br />
And it&#8217;s made me realise just what I had</p>
<p>Love is blind, it&#8217;s true, nobody is like you<br />
My endless melody I play for me and you<br />
Love is blind, it&#8217;s true, I&#8217;m on my knees for you<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;d give it all I can to have you back again<br />
Love is blind</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re gone and I let it slip away<br />
I can&#8217;t believe I was the one who caused you pain<br />
I said you should know deep down inside<br />
She didn&#8217;t mean a thing to me, yeah<br />
What can I do to win back your heart and make you to stay?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe, can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;re gone<br />
I can&#8217;t believe&#8230;</p>
<p>Love is blind, it&#8217;s true, nobody is like you<br />
My endless melody I play for me and you<br />
Love is blind, it&#8217;s true, I&#8217;m on my knees for you<br />
&#8216;Cause I&#8217;d give it all I can to have you back again<br />
Love is blind</p>
<p>Love is blind</p>
