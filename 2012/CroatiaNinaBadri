Listen to me when I tell you I&#8217;ve tried everything<br />
You&#8217;re still in my thoughts, it still feels like you&#8217;re mine<br />
But I hear you&#8217;re in love and people tell me you care<br />
It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve lost my mind, I still hope for you</p>
<p>But heaven gives everything back and remembers every debt<br />
Each one of us dreams and heaven determines our path<br />
Heaven gives everything back, someone up there sees it all<br />
These tears of mine will become your burden</p>
<p>But I hear you&#8217;re in love and people tell me you care<br />
It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve lost my mind, I still hope for you</p>
<p>Well heaven gives everything back and remembers every debt<br />
Each one of us dreams and heaven determines our path<br />
Heaven gives everything back, someone up there sees it all<br />
And these tears of mine you&#8217;ll carry upon your conscience</p>
<p>(Someone up there sees it all)<br />
Well heaven gives everything back and remembers every debt<br />
Each one of us dreams and heaven determines our path</p>
<p>(Heaven gives everything back, someone up there sees it all)<br />
Someone up there sees it all<br />
(And these tears of mine you&#8217;ll carry upon your conscience)</p>
<p>Someone up there sees it all<br />
