Sorry if I didn&#8217;t know how to say<br />
That you were everything to me<br />
Sorry for the pain</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry for each tear<br />
I know I don&#8217;t deserve more<br />
But if I don&#8217;t have you here, I can&#8217;t live<br />
Stay with me, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>Forgive me if I didn&#8217;t know how to love you, love<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my heart<br />
Stay with me, stay with me<br />
If you&#8217;re not here, the sun doesn&#8217;t rise</p>
<p>There are no memories of yesterday<br />
Only the hours on your skin, loving you<br />
Stay with me, don&#8217;t leave</p>
<p>Forgive me if I didn&#8217;t know how to love you, love<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my heart<br />
Stay with me, stay with me<br />
If you&#8217;re not here, the sun doesn&#8217;t rise</p>
<p>And now that I see you going<br />
I know I won&#8217;t forget you</p>
<p>(If I didn&#8217;t know how to love you, love)<br />
If I didn&#8217;t know how to love you, love<br />
(It wasn&#8217;t my heart) No&#8230;<br />
Stay with me, stay with me<br />
If you&#8217;re not here, the sun doesn&#8217;t rise</p>
<p>And now that I see you going (And now that I see you going)<br />
I know I won&#8217;t forget you (I know I won&#8217;t forget you)<br />
Stay with me, stay with me<br />
If you&#8217;re not here, the sun doesn&#8217;t rise<br />
