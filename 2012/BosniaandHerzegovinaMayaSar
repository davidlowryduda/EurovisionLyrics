I know your moves, you rush like without your head<br />
Where, I don&#8217;t ask, because if I ask, you stay silent<br />
And it&#8217;s ever harder to part with you and your body<br />
And I know you less and less, that&#8217;s not what I wanted</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if I&#8217;m stealing you away from everybody just for me<br />
May they leave you, may they not touch you<br />
I poison blood and soul most when I wound you<br />
And I still hate it all while I defend myself in front of you</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ruin my day, it&#8217;s never been harder for me<br />
You&#8217;ve never lived alone in a spider&#8217;s web<br />
Like I have, life connects me to you<br />
Will it ever get easier or only harder, eh&#8230;.</p>
<p>When you easily put our whole life in a gamble<br />
As if we never said, &#8220;Till death do us part&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ruin my day, it&#8217;s never been harder for me<br />
You&#8217;ve never lived alone in a spider&#8217;s web<br />
Like I have&#8230;<br />
Like I have&#8230;</p>
<p>I know your moves<br />
