<p>You, you are my best friend<br />
You are my everything, so don&#8217;t leave me now<br />
You, you are the best of me<br />
The reason that I believe, so don&#8217;t leave me now</p>
<p>And I try to keep us alive<br />
But you&#8217;re cold, cold, cold<br />
Now every second that my heart skips, it ends</p>
<p>But I still wanna keep us alive<br />
But it&#8217;s cold, cold, cold, cold when the music dies<br />
It&#8217;s all black and white and there&#8217;s no sunrise<br />
When the music dies</p>
<p>No you, you can&#8217;t even look at me<br />
Still not gonna speak to me<br />
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</p>
<p>And I try to keep us alive<br />
But you&#8217;re cold, cold, cold<br />
Now every second that my heart skips, it ends</p>
<p>But I try to keep us alive<br />
But it&#8217;s cold, cold, cold, cold<br />
When the music dies (Cold, cold, cold)<br />
It gets cold and there&#8217;s no sunrise (Cold, cold, cold)</p>
<p>So cold, now every second that my heart skips, it ends</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; try to keep us alive<br />
But you&#8217;re cold, cold, so cold<br />
Every second my heartbeat ends</p>
<p>Still I try to keep us alive<br />
But you&#8217;re cold, cold, cold<br />
When the music dies</p>
