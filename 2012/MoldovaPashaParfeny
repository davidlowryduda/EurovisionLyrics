<p>At the wedding tonight, she looks nicer than the bride<br />
When she smiles, I forget my lyrics<br />
I got blind, I got mad, not from the diamonds she had<br />
But from the beauty that put my heart on fire</p>
<p>You have never been to my show<br />
You haven&#8217;t seen before how looks the trumpet<br />
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control<br />
This trumpet makes you my girl</p>
<p>(This trumpet makes you my girl)</p>
<p>Just like from paradise, you came down from the skies<br />
On a plane which belongs to your daddy<br />
Welcome to carousel, the wine is sweet, but take care<br />
&#8216;Cause too much is no good for a princess</p>
<p>You have never been to my show<br />
You haven&#8217;t seen before how looks the trumpet<br />
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control<br />
This trumpet makes you my girl</p>
<p>You have never been to my show<br />
You haven&#8217;t seen before how looks the trumpet<br />
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t seen before<br />
(You&#8217;ve never seen before) How looks the trumpet<br />
But the sound goes straight to your soul, gets you out of control<br />
This trumpet makes you (My girl)</p>
<p>This trumpet makes you (My girl)<br />
This trumpet makes you my girl<br />
This trumpet makes you my girl</p>
