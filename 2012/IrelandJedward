<p>Floodgates, can&#8217;t wait<br />
Here she comes, shut &#8216;em fast<br />
Better shut &#8216;em fast<br />
Too late, swept away<br />
Feel the rush after the fact</p>
<p>Coming up beneath me<br />
Never been in love so deeply before</p>
<p>I am close to the waterline<br />
I thought that I&#8217;d been over my head for the last time<br />
I&#8217;m so close to the waterline<br />
And the way I&#8217;m loving her now<br />
I know this is bound to go down as the big one</p>
<p>Whistle blast, lights flash<br />
Throw a rope, grab a hold, feel the undertow<br />
She laughs, waves crash<br />
What&#8217;s the use? I can&#8217;t let her go</p>
<p>Coming up beneath me<br />
Never been in love so deeply before</p>
<p>I am close to the waterline<br />
I thought that I&#8217;d been over my head for the last time<br />
I&#8217;m so close to the waterline<br />
And the way I&#8217;m loving her now<br />
I know this is bound to go down as the big one</p>
<p>Floodgates, can&#8217;t wait<br />
Here she comes, shut&#8217; em fast<br />
Better shut &#8216;em fast<br />
Too late, swept away<br />
Feel the rush</p>
<p>I am close to the waterline<br />
And the way I&#8217;m loving her now<br />
I know this is bound to go down as the one</p>
<p>I am close to the waterline<br />
I thought that I&#8217;d been over my head for the last time<br />
I&#8217;m so close to the waterline<br />
And the way I&#8217;m loving her now<br />
I know this is bound to go down as the big one</p>
