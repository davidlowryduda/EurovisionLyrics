The song has no limits, language and colour<br />
It doesn&#8217;t recognize who&#8217;s poor and who&#8217;s rich<br />
Everybody sings in this world, sings about love</p>
<p>Love has no limits, language and colour<br />
It&#8217;s equal for everybody on this world<br />
For me, for you, for them</p>
<p>I love you so much, I love you so much<br />
I love you, I love you, my darling<br />
I love you, I love only you<br />
I say that I love you</p>
<p>I love you so much, I love you so much<br />
I love you, I love you, I love you<br />
I love you, I love only you<br />
There are no limits for us</p>
<p>Pain has no limits, language and colour<br />
It doesn&#8217;t recognize who&#8217;s poor and who&#8217;s rich<br />
The same tears fall when life wounds us</p>
<p>Love has no limits, language and colour<br />
It`s equal for everybody on this world<br />
For me, for you, for them </p>
<p>I love you so much, I love you so much<br />
I love you, I love you, my darling<br />
I love you, I love only you<br />
I say that I love you</p>
<p>I love you so much, I love you so much<br />
I love you, I love you, I love you<br />
I love you, I love only you<br />
