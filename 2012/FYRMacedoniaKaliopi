Look into my eyes now<br />
I&#8217;m not a loser you know<br />
I don&#8217;t give in until the end<br />
There is no birth without falling</p>
<p>Open your soul and admit to me<br />
What we are now, you and me<br />
Half of me is in you<br />
And half of you sleeps in me<br />
Come on and embrace me, raise me to heaven</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
One truth and one lie<br />
And when we are together<br />
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
Nothing separates good and bad<br />
Give me a smile<br />
The day is leading me to white nights</p>
<p>Look into my eyes now<br />
You will find everything there<br />
Come on and give yourself to the end<br />
For a new rebirth, with me</p>
<p>Open your soul and admit to me<br />
What we are now, you and me<br />
Half of me is in you<br />
And half of you sleeps in me<br />
Come on and embrace me, raise me to heaven</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
One truth and one lie<br />
And when we are together<br />
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
Nothing separates good and bad<br />
Give me a smile<br />
The day is leading me to white nights</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
One truth and one lie<br />
And when we are together<br />
I choose happiness, you choose sorrow</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
Nothing separates good and bad<br />
Give me a smile<br />
The day is leading me to white nights</p>
<p>Everything is black and white<br />
