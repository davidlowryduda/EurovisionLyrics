<p>I hear the echo of our rhythmic steps<br />
Marching, never in the same direction<br />
We move on, but what are we running after?</p>
<p>I hear the echo of our dreams, of our desires<br />
Every day until the night<br />
We practice, and what are we running after?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re confused, we hope<br />
Somewhere we get lost<br />
One day we will see each other again</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear the echo of our swinging steps<br />
That and there, always the same dance<br />
We move on, but what are we running after?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re confused, we hope<br />
Somewhere we get lost<br />
One day we will see each other again</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hear the echo of your voice moving away from me<br />
The echo of a love that one day will return<br />
It carries me off and I run after you</p>
<p>We&#8217;re confused, we hope<br />
Somewhere we get lost<br />
One day we will see each other again</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
