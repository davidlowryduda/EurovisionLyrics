<p>Should&#8217;ve known better<br />
Now I miss you like Sahara miss the rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s true, maybe you&#8217;re not gonna change</p>
<p>I feel like you have two homes<br />
Yet I feel you are homeless<br />
Where we live I feel like a stranger<br />
When you home I feel even stranger</p>
<p>I live in no man&#8217;s land<br />
With no way home like you don&#8217;t understand<br />
&#8216;Cause you so here, you so there, not really anywhere<br />
She said&#8230;</p>
<p>Should&#8217;ve known better<br />
Now I miss you like Sahara miss the rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s true, maybe you&#8217;re not gonna change</p>
<p>Feels like I&#8217;m always living out of my suitcase<br />
What about all the years in between<br />
Just trying to find my place</p>
<p>I live in no man&#8217;s land<br />
With no way home like you don&#8217;t understand<br />
&#8216;Cause you so here, you so there not really anywhere<br />
She said&#8230;</p>
<p>She said&#8230;</p>
<p>We could&#8217;ve written words on a mountain high<br />
Reminding ourselves to keep climbing, right<br />
Sometimes we have to lose<br />
A part of us to find the truth</p>
<p>Nothing more beautiful than the way<br />
You used to breathe me into your lungs and soul<br />
Sometimes we have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t stay&#8221;</p>
<p>Should&#8217;ve known better<br />
Now I miss you like Sahara miss the rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s true, maybe it&#8217;s true</p>
<p>Oh should&#8217;ve known better<br />
Now I miss you like Sahara miss the rain<br />
Changing like the weather<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s true, maybe we&#8217;re not gonna change</p>
<p>Should&#8217;ve known better<br />
Should&#8217;ve known better</p>
