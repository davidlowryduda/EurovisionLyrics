<p>I was five, you were three<br />
We were dancing in the street<br />
And you looked just like an angel</p>
<p>You looked up and saw the sky<br />
Saw the birds and wondered why<br />
They could fly away so high</p>
<p>In the morning I would wake<br />
And my heart just couldn&#8217;t wait<br />
To play in your backyard</p>
<p>In the evening I would go<br />
Telling you I love you so<br />
And I couldn&#8217;t wait to see you again</p>
<p>It&#8217;s you and me and everybody out there<br />
And I can see that everybody knows<br />
About you and me, but I don&#8217;t really care for it<br />
I can see that everybody knows about us</p>
<p>We grew up knowing love<br />
Thanking God up above<br />
That we could be together forever</p>
<p>We would never say goodbye<br />
&#8216;Cause we promised, you and I<br />
But our love couldn&#8217;t handle time</p>
<p>And I see you walking by my house<br />
And wonder why we don&#8217;t play around no more<br />
Such a shame we have no time<br />
They were wrong and we were right<br />
I still love you and in my mind</p>
<p>It&#8217;s you and me and everybody out there<br />
And I can see that everybody knows<br />
About you and me, but I don&#8217;t really care for it<br />
I can see that everybody knows about us</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m lying in bed thinking &#8217;bout the old days<br />
Thinking &#8217;bout it all and how it ends sometimes<br />
Was it wrong or right or was I good enough?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s you and me and everybody out there<br />
And I can see that everybody knows<br />
About you and me and everybody out there<br />
And I can see that everybody knows</p>
<p>About you and me, but I don&#8217;t really care for it<br />
I can see that everybody knows about us</p>
