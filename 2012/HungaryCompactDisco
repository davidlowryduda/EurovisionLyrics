<p>The whole big world is just one place<br />
You can say it&#8217;s all the same<br />
You may feel hatreds it sows<br />
We can show it&#8217;s no way to go </p>
<p>This is the sound of our hearts, if you listen<br />
This is a zeal from above and it can say it all<br />
This is a fever they can&#8217;t take away<br />
This is the sound of, the sound of, the sound of our hearts</p>
<p>The sound of our hearts<br />
The sound of our hearts</p>
<p>Harmony can be achieved<br />
Just find some way to get connected<br />
Differences may not be wrong<br />
They enrich the things that we know</p>
<p>Different faiths, different views<br />
All we can do is to turn them in key </p>
<p>This is the sound of our hearts, if you listen<br />
This is a zeal from above and it can say it all<br />
This is a fever they can&#8217;t take away<br />
This is the sound of, the sound of, the sound</p>
<p>This is the sound of our hearts, if you listen<br />
This is a zeal from above and it can say it all<br />
This a fever they can&#8217;t take away<br />
This is the sound of, the sound of, the sound of our hearts</p>
<p>The sound of our hearts<br />
The sound of our hearts</p>
