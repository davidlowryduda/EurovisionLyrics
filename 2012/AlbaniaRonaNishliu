<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
In this world, love lives no more<br />
Time no longer has time for us, no<br />
Ho&#8230; no oh oh, oh oh<br />
No oh oh oh&#8230; no oh oh oh&#8230;<br />
Time no longer has time for us</p>
<p>My plane is landing<br />
On the unlit runway of your soul<br />
They elbow their way through today</p>
<p>Those who couldn&#8217;t live yesterday<br />
But yesterdays have no importance<br />
They were swallowed by the turbulent seas<br />
Oh, tomorrows won&#8217;t bring anything<br />
But hopeless hope and insanity</p>
<p>Just let me cry&#8230; cry&#8230; cry&#8230;<br />
For this is the best I can do now<br />
For this is the best I can do now</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Just let me cry&#8230; cry&#8230; cry&#8230;<br />
For this is the best I can do now<br />
For this is the best I can do now<br />
