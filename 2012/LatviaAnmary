<p>I was born in distant 1980<br />
The year that Irish Johnny Logan won<br />
Thirty years or more, they still remember<br />
So dream away, today&#8217;s the day I&#8217;m singing my song</p>
<p>When I join this grand parade of winners<br />
And will make this song a worldwide hit<br />
I will buy, oh, my own mic to sing in<br />
And all the jobs I had before I&#8217;m surely gonna quit</p>
<p>Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on<br />
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves<br />
Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on<br />
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves</p>
<p>My mamma said to grow and be a singer<br />
Dad just smiled and gave me my guitar<br />
I did my best and I&#8217;ll be so much better<br />
Brightest and the highest and the furthest of the stars</p>
<p>And on the day when Sir Mick Jagger phones me<br />
Tell him please that I am very busy<br />
Writing brand new songs for Paul McCartney<br />
&#8220;So sorry Mick, I&#8217;ll call you back, one day I&#8217;ll call you back&#8221;</p>
<p>Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on<br />
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves<br />
Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows and plays on and on<br />
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves</p>
<p>Beautiful song is on the radio, is in the TV shows<br />
Beautiful song that everybody hums and everybody loves</p>
