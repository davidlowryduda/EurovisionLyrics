Tucked closely together, the scent of us both<br />
I turn around, the same shirt in blue<br />
This scent would be nothing without you</p>
<p>Like a sea without water, like a lantern without light<br />
A life without colours &#8211; that&#8217;s not you<br />
Someone you see when you close your eyes, like an angel before you<br />
Someone who helps you to fly when you&#8217;ve forgotten how to</p>
<p>Being in love without feelings or laughing without sound<br />
A life without colours &#8211; that&#8217;s not you<br />
Someone who has forgotten all troubles, a woman with courage<br />
Someone who understands what you say even if you speak no words</p>
<p>Have a seat, we&#8217;ll hold your hand<br />
Tell us who you are, we exist for one another<br />
All memories would be nothing without you.</p>
<p>Like a sea without water, like a lantern without light<br />
A life without colours &#8211; that&#8217;s not you<br />
Someone you see when you close your eyes, like an angel before you<br />
Someone who helps you to fly when you&#8217;ve forgotten how to</p>
<p>Being in love without feelings or laughing without sound<br />
A life without colours &#8211; that&#8217;s not you<br />
Someone who has forgotten all troubles, a woman with courage<br />
Someone who understands what you say even if you speak no words</p>
<p>Like a sea without water, like a lantern without light<br />
A life without colours &#8211; that&#8217;s not you<br />
Someone you see when you close your eyes, like an angel before you<br />
Someone who helps you to fly when you&#8217;ve forgotten how to</p>
<p>Being in love without feelings or laughing without sound<br />
A life without colours &#8211; that&#8217;s not you<br />
Someone who has forgotten all troubles, a woman with courage<br />
Someone who understands what you say even if you speak no words<br />
