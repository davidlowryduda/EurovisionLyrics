<p>So graceful and pure, a smile bathed in light<br />
No matter the distance, a miracle of sight<br />
Though I should have known, I could not turn away<br />
When faced with your beauty no reason can stay</p>
<p>As you kiss him in the moonlight<br />
With heavy words I say</p>
<p>If you love someone, follow your heart<br />
&#8216;Cause love comes once if youâ€™re lucky enough<br />
Though I&#8217;ll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep<br />
Only love can set you free</p>
<p>Trust in your dreams, run with no fear<br />
And if you should stumble remember I&#8217;m near<br />
As a ghost I will walk, I&#8217;ll look deep in my soul<br />
I might find another, you gave me that hope</p>
<p>So as you kiss him in the moonlight<br />
With heavy words I say</p>
<p>If you love someone, follow your heart<br />
&#8216;Cause love comes once if you&#8217;re lucky enough<br />
Though I&#8217;ll miss you forever and the hurt will run deep<br />
Only love can set you free</p>
<p>And if you love someone, follow your heart<br />
&#8216;Cause love comes once if you&#8217;re lucky enough<br />
Though I&#8217;ll miss you forever, the hurt will run deep<br />
Love will set you free&#8230;</p>
