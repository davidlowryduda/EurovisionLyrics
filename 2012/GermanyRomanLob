<p>Guess we knew this was coming on<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re already gone in my head<br />
You can tell me that I&#8217;m wrong<br />
That you&#8217;re staying with me instead</p>
<p>When winter&#8217;s come along and summer&#8217;s dead and gone<br />
Is there anything left here to say?<br />
I can put my arms around the emptiness I found<br />
And find a way to make you stay</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m standing still, I&#8217;m standing still<br />
As you leave me now<br />
I&#8217;m standing still, I&#8217;m standing still<br />
As you&#8217;re walking out<br />
I&#8217;m just standing still</p>
<p>Never thought I&#8217;d be this strong<br />
But pieces of me break so easy<br />
What I thought would be the end<br />
Is just the feeling that you freed me</p>
<p>Girl this ain&#8217;t giving up, it&#8217;s knowing when to stop<br />
Knowing everything is over<br />
I know my love is blind, I see for the first time<br />
Things ain&#8217;t gonna bring us closer</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m standing still, I&#8217;m standing still<br />
As you leave me now, yeah<br />
I&#8217;m standing still, I&#8217;m standing still<br />
As you&#8217;re walking out</p>
<p>I&#8217;m standing still&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m just standing still as you leave me now<br />
I&#8217;m just standing still</p>
<p>When winter&#8217;s come along and summer&#8217;s dead and gone<br />
Is there anything left here to say?<br />
I can put my arms around the emptiness I found<br />
And find a way to make you stay</p>
<p>I&#8217;m standing still, I&#8217;m standing still<br />
As you leave me now, yeah<br />
I&#8217;m standing still, I&#8217;m standing still<br />
As you&#8217;re walking out<br />
I&#8217;m just standing still</p>
