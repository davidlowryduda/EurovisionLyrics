Ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230;</p>
<p>I am longing from the bottom of my heart, drawing sun across the sky<br />
Over the dreams just for him, casting light onto his shadows<br />
To bid farewell of memories which have holes<br />
As between the palms of hands, while the sand of time drains</p>
<p>I believe that again, we will reconcile<br />
And yesterday will return for good with streams of light<br />
Even the song will find it&#8217;s rhymes if I hold to him</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230;</p>
<p>I sense I am drawing to a close, a silent voice is singing in minor scale<br />
However, there won&#8217;t be wind to blow white flags</p>
<p>I believe that again, we will reconcile<br />
And yesterday will return for good with streams of light<br />
A new day is shining a real sun</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; (Because I do not surrender until the very end)<br />
(Because I do not surrender until the very end)<br />
Because I do not surrender until the very end<br />
I survive in my own way<br />
By longing, oh&#8230; (Because I do not surrender until the very end)<br />
