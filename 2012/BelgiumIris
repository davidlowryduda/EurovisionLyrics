<p>Come and find me, I&#8217;ve been hiding from you<br />
Come and get me, running from you<br />
It&#8217;s been easy, easy for you to believe me<br />
When I say I love you</p>
<p>But what would you do when my house was empty?<br />
My life in a bag and away from you<br />
You took my love for granted, would you really miss me?<br />
Any other guy would do, but would you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a secret and a question for you<br />
Where are they now? What are you gonna do?<br />
If you run here and wait for me now, are we done here?<br />
Or starting somehow?</p>
<p>But what would you do when my house was empty?<br />
My life in a bag and away from you<br />
You took my love for granted, would you really miss me?<br />
Any other guy would do, but would you? Would you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a two-way street<br />
And I know that<br />
But don&#8217;t look back<br />
Still I wonder, still I wonder</p>
<p>But what would you do when my house was empty?<br />
My life in a bag just to be with you<br />
But when I&#8217;m at your door will you say you miss me?<br />
Any other guy would do<br />
Yeah, other guy would do, but would you?</p>
<p>But would you?<br />
Oh would you?<br />
I love you</p>
