<p>I hear the music as I walk down the street<br />
Start moving to the rhythm, heart is pumping the beat<br />
I hear the people shout out, &#8220;Turn up the music louder&#8221;<br />
Better start running if you can&#8217;t stand the heat</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it doing to me? I feel it setting me free<br />
It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m losing all control<br />
You know it&#8217;s making me hot and baby I don&#8217;t stop<br />
It&#8217;s like a fire in my soul</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing tonight<br />
But this rushing is making me stronger<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s wrong or it&#8217;s right<br />
But I know I want you to stay<br />
Nananananana stay, nananananana</p>
<p>Heart beats faster as I stand in the crowd<br />
My meters are peaking, I can tell you&#8217;re around<br />
It&#8217;s like I wanna (shout out), nothing can pull me (down now)<br />
Sirens are calling and I can&#8217;t kill the sound</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it doing to me? I feel it setting me free<br />
It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m losing all control<br />
You know it&#8217;s making me hot and baby I don&#8217;t stop<br />
It&#8217;s like a fire in my soul</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing tonight<br />
But this rushing is making me stronger<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s wrong or it&#8217;s right<br />
But I know I want you to stay<br />
Nananananana stay, nananananana</p>
<p>What can move your body baby?<br />
You better, nananananana, you better, nananananana<br />
Come on now, what can move your body baby?<br />
You better, nananananana, you better</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing tonight<br />
But this rushing is making me stronger<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s wrong or it&#8217;s right<br />
But I know I want you to stay</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing tonight<br />
But this rushing is making me stronger<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s wrong or it&#8217;s right<br />
But I know I want you to stay<br />
Nananananana stay, nananananana</p>
