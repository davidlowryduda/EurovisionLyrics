<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Unbelievable, I can&#8217;t wait to go<br />
But like a rolling stone, you hit me &#8211; boom boom boom<br />
If you were my king, would I be your queen?<br />
Stop breaking up my heart, you kill me &#8211; boom boom boom</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>(Day and night, it&#8217;s a fight) Don&#8217;t know where you are<br />
When I&#8217;m close you&#8217;re far, oh, no no no<br />
(Day and night, it&#8217;s a lie)<br />
I waste my tears and you shoot pool</em></font></p>
<p>Love is female, if you don&#8217;t get by<br />
(Tick tock, you don&#8217;t get by)<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>This is the mess you left, I&#8217;m out of love and it&#8217;s a fact<br />
(You left, out of love and it&#8217;s a fact)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll smile, you have to go<br />
You&#8217;re an independent grown man after all<br />
Out of love, must have been sent from up above<br />
Lala lala lala la&#8230;</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Ooh&#8230; lalalala&#8230;</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Have you turned to stone? King without a throne<br />
You&#8217;re great, but not impressive, lots of up and low<br />
It&#8217;s so typical: when it&#8217;s time to go<br />
You knock me on the floor &#8211; my heart goes boom, boom, boom</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>(Day and night, it&#8217;s a fight) Don&#8217;t know where to start<br />
When you&#8217;re close I&#8217;m far, no no no no<br />
(Day and night, it&#8217;s a lie)<br />
I dried my tears, but you want more</em></font></p>
<p>Love is female, if you don&#8217;t get by<br />
(Tick tock, you don&#8217;t get by)<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Clean up the mess you left, I&#8217;m out of love and it&#8217;s a fact<br />
(You left, out of love and it&#8217;s a fact)</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll smile, ready to go<br />
You&#8217;re an independent grown man after all<br />
Out of love, must have been sent from up above<br />
Lala lala lala la&#8230;</em></font></p>
<p>But how hot it is now<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;ll let you think twice, I don&#8217;t wanna cause any pressure<br />
But have you asked yourself why I bought a brand new gun shot</em></font></p>
<p>Love is female, if you don&#8217;t get by<br />
(Tick tock, you don&#8217;t get by)<br />
I take it easy, calculating the chances<br />
(Tick tock, one chance)</p>
<p>What do you want that you don&#8217;t have?<br />
We are all dissatisfied, but why?<br />
Female, but you don&#8217;t get by<br />
Lala lala lala la&#8230;<br />
