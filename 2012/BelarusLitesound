<p>When the night is falling from the sky<br />
Just keep driving on a highway<br />
When the world is deaf to all your cries<br />
Just keep going, you&#8217;ll be there someday</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not alone, we&#8217;re against them all<br />
Hold on to me, I&#8217;ll never let you fall<br />
Even if someday all hope is gone<br />
I will not give up</p>
<p>Whatever&#8217;s standing in my way we&#8217;ll make it through the day<br />
&#8216;Cause we are the winners, we are the heroes<br />
We&#8217;re breaking down the walls, we&#8217;re gonna hit them all<br />
&#8216;Cause we are believers, we are the dreamers</p>
<p>No matter what they say, no matter what they do<br />
I&#8217;ll make it alright, I&#8217;ll make it for you<br />
We&#8217;re breaking down the walls<br />
We are the heroes</p>
<p>As I stand beneath the starry sky<br />
I just lose faith in gravity<br />
And it feels like I can learn to fly<br />
Bring to life all my fantasies</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not alone, we&#8217;re against them all<br />
Hold on to me, I&#8217;ll never let you fall<br />
Even if someday all hope is gone<br />
I will not give up</p>
<p>Whatever&#8217;s standing in my way we&#8217;ll make it through the day<br />
&#8216;Cause we are the winners, we are the heroes<br />
We&#8217;re breaking down the walls, we&#8217;re gonna hit them all<br />
&#8216;Cause we are believers, we are the dreamers</p>
<p>No matter what they say, no matter what they do<br />
I&#8217;ll make it alright, I&#8217;ll make it for you<br />
We&#8217;re breaking down the walls<br />
We are the heroes, we are the heroes</p>
<p>Whatever&#8217;s standing in my way we&#8217;ll make it through the day<br />
&#8216;Cause we are the winners, we are the heroes<br />
We&#8217;re breaking down the walls, we&#8217;re gonna hit them all<br />
&#8216;Cause we are believers, we are the dreamers</p>
<p>No matter what they say, no matter what they do<br />
I&#8217;ll make it alright, I&#8217;ll make it for you<br />
We&#8217;re breaking down the walls<br />
We are the heroes</p>
