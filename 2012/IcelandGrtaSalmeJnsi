<p>She&#8217;s singing softly in the night<br />
Praying for the morning light<br />
She dreams of how they used to be<br />
At dawn they will be free</p>
<p>Memories they haunt his mind<br />
Save him from the endless night<br />
She whispers warm and tenderly<br />
Please come back to me</p>
<p>And when the golden sun arises far across the sea<br />
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever we&#8217;ll be free</p>
<p>Never forget what I did, what I said<br />
When I gave you all my heart and soul<br />
Morning will come and I know we&#8217;ll be one<br />
&#8216;Cause I still believe that you&#8217;ll remember me</p>
<p>She mourns beneath the moonlit sky<br />
Remembering when they said goodbye<br />
Where&#8217;s the one he used to know<br />
It seems so long ago</p>
<p>And when the golden sun arises far across the sea<br />
The dawn will break as darkness fades forever we&#8217;ll be free</p>
<p>Never forget what I did, what I said<br />
When I gave you all my heart and soul<br />
Morning will come and I know we&#8217;ll be one<br />
&#8216;Cause I still believe that you&#8217;ll remember me</p>
<p>Never forget what I did, what I said<br />
When I gave you all my heart and soul<br />
Morning will come and I know we&#8217;ll be one<br />
&#8216;Cause I still believe that you&#8217;ll remember me</p>
<p>Oh, I still believe that you&#8217;ll remember me<br />
Oh, I still believe that you&#8217;ll remember me</p>
