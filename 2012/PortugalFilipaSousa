I walk along the streets of the city, old, dark, imperfect<br />
It smells like yearning kisses, in a embellishing square<br />
A child is running, a neighbour is peeking<br />
And within me the desire to return and embrace you</p>
<p>And within me the desire to return and embrace you</p>
<p>If you were light, my love, oh light of the day<br />
Inspiring smile of fantasy<br />
If you were water, my love, like pure water<br />
That quenches the thirst of the tenderness flower</p>
<p>If you were light, my love, oh light of the day<br />
Inspiring smile of fantasy<br />
But among everything you can become in your life<br />
I only want, my love, be the life of mine</p>
<p>And within me the desire to return and embrace you</p>
<p>If you were light, my love, oh light of the day<br />
Inspiring smile of fantasy<br />
If you were water, my love, like pure water<br />
That quenches the thirst of the tenderness flower</p>
<p>If you were light, my love, oh light of the day<br />
Inspiring smile of fantasy<br />
But among everything you can become in your life<br />
I only want, my love, be the life of mine</p>
<p>But among everything you can become in your life<br />
I only want, my love, be the life of mine<br />
