<p>I&#8217;m gonna tell you what&#8217;s inside my soul<br />
We are so fragile, just like melting snow<br />
We&#8217;ve got to come to see the beauty of love<br />
And imagine, and imagine, just imagine</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re like butterflies flying to the sun<br />
The sun will never let us look inside<br />
I believe that this&#8217;ll be opened up<br />
But at the right time<br />
Heartfully just wait for it, it will come</p>
<p>And even if you often were so wrong<br />
And you denied the miracle&#8217;s possible<br />
But you have got to see it anyway<br />
And imagine, and imagine, just imagine</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re like butterflies flying to the sun<br />
The sun will never let us look inside<br />
I believe that this&#8217;ll be opened up<br />
But at the right time<br />
Heartfully just wait for it, it will come</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re like butterflies flying to the sun (The sun)<br />
The sun will never let us look inside (Look inside, I believe)<br />
I believe that this&#8217;ll be opened up<br />
But at the right time</p>
<p>Heartfully just wait for it<br />
And all the secrets will come, come out</p>
