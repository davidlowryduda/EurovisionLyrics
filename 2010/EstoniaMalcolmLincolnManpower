<p>Siren in my head is making awful sound<br />
It&#8217;s time to make it clear what is lost and what is found</p>
<p>My life has been oh lame, has been oh lame so far<br />
I wasted years, I wasted time trying to reach the stars<br />
My life has been oh lame, has been oh lame so far</p>
<p>Give me time and give me strength, give me strength to carry on<br />
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night<br />
Give me time and give me strength, give me strength to carry on<br />
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night</p>
<p>Siren in my head, yes I can hear it again<br />
Is it just the beginning or is it the end?</p>
<p>My life has been oh lame, has been oh lame so far<br />
I wasted years, I wasted time trying to reach the stars<br />
My life has been oh lame, has been oh lame so far</p>
<p>Give me time and give me strength, give me strength to carry on<br />
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night<br />
Give me time and give me strength, give me strength to carry on<br />
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night</p>
<p>Give me time and give me strength, give me strength to carry on<br />
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night<br />
Give me time and give me strength, give me strength to carry on<br />
Give me bit of hope now, help me through the night</p>
