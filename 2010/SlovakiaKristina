When the sun sets in Horehronie<br />
I want to sing, die and live<br />
When the sun sets in Horehronie<br />
I wish I could get closer to heaven</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lying on the grass and dreaming<br />
I don&#8217;t even know what about<br />
In the breeze that gently sways me<br />
When the sun goes down</p>
<p>The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie<br />
A silent brotherhood tells me that<br />
I return here when I feel sad<br />
The trees tell me: shake it off</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lying on the grass and dreaming<br />
I don&#8217;t even know what about<br />
In the breeze that gently sways me<br />
When the sun goes down</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; hallelujah&#8230;</p>
<p>When the sun sets in Horehronie<br />
Somewhere in the distance our bell is ringing<br />
When it hurts, let it hurt<br />
One day it will disappear into the black mountains</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lying on the grass and dreaming<br />
My eyes are crying softly<br />
In the breeze that gently sways me<br />
When the sun goes down</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m lying on the grass and dreaming<br />
My eyes are crying softly<br />
In the breeze that gently sways me<br />
When the sun goes down</p>
<p>The most beautiful trees are in Horehronie<br />
