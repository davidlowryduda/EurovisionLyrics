<p>I&#8217;ve asked my angels why but they don&#8217;t know<br />
What for do mothers cry and rivers flow?<br />
Why are the skies so blue and mountains high?<br />
What for is your love always passing by?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked my uncle Joe but he can&#8217;t speak<br />
Why does the wind still blow and blood still leaks?<br />
So many questions now with no reply<br />
What for do people live until they die?</p>
<p>What for are we living? What for are we crying?<br />
What for are we dying? Only Mr God knows why<br />
What for are we living? What for are we dreaming?<br />
What for are we losing? Only Mr God knows why<br />
But his phone today is out of range</p>
<p>The sun in colour black is rising high<br />
The time is turning back, I wonder why<br />
So many questions now with no reply<br />
What for do people live until they die?</p>
<p>(What for are we living?) What for we&#8217;re living?<br />
(What for are we crying?) Crying<br />
(What for are we dying?) Dying<br />
(Only Mr God knows why) Mr God knows why</p>
<p>(What for are we living?)<br />
(What for are we dreaming?) Dreaming<br />
(What for are we losing?)<br />
Only Mr God knows why</p>
