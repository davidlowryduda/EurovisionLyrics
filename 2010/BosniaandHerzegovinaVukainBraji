<p>Say just one more word<br />
And you will make it end<br />
And I will leave this place</p>
<p>Only anger will remain<br />
And it doesn&#8217;t seem to me<br />
We&#8217;re each other&#8217;s better side<br />
These days</p>
<p>This is the time to melt the ice<br />
Off our lips and off our hearts<br />
Thunder and lightning holding hands<br />
Let&#8217;s overcome the past</p>
<p>The drought is all around<br />
But if we start breathing together<br />
We can bring the rain down</p>
<p>For a dream, for a brand new day<br />
To wash away our sins<br />
And carry them away</p>
<p>This is the time to melt the ice<br />
Off our lips and off our hearts<br />
Thunder and lightning holding hands<br />
Let&#8217;s overcome the past<br />
We have to do it fast</p>
<p>This is the time (To melt the ice)<br />
(Off our lips and off our hearts) Off our hearts<br />
(Thunder and lightning holding hands) Thunder and lightning<br />
(Let&#8217;s overcome the past)<br />
(We have to do it fast)</p>
<p>In this crazy world<br />
In this crazy world<br />
Just you and I</p>
<p>Say just one more word<br />
And everything will end<br />
Everyone will leave</p>
