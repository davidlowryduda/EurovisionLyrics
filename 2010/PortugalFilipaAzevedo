There are days like this, that leave us alone<br />
The soul empty, the hurt in the voice<br />
We wore away the hands, so much we squeezed them<br />
There are no words anymore, because we shut them so much</p>
<p>There is a song that I haven&#8217;t sung to you<br />
Verses still to rhyme, poems that I&#8217;ve never invented<br />
Who set us this way? The life torn apart<br />
Who took you away from me? It stole me the soul<br />
But doesn&#8217;t know anything about you</p>
<p>There are days like this, no need to hide it<br />
To fear words, to love or suffer<br />
To cover senses, to pretend that there&#8217;s nothing<br />
There are days lost between here and there</p>
<p>There is a song that I haven&#8217;t sung to you<br />
Verses still to rhyme, poems that I&#8217;ve never invented<br />
Who set us this way? The life torn apart<br />
Who took you away from me? It stole me the soul<br />
But doesn&#8217;t know anything about you</p>
<p>I know that one day you will know that life is only one<br />
It doesn&#8217;t turn back</p>
<p>Who set us this way? The life torn apart<br />
Who took you away from me? It stole me the soul<br />
But doesn&#8217;t know anything about you<br />
