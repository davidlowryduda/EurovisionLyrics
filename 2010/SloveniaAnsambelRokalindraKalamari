Let there be (Let there be, let there be) a change of the scene<br />
Let everyone (Let everyone, let everyone) go crazy about this sound<br />
Let it run through their veins, let it strike right into the heart<br />
Native folk rock</p>
<p>Polka is the queen in Slovenian land<br />
It brings out the dance, shrieks and laughter<br />
Rock is the king of partying, sharp but sincere<br />
Hot like summer, colourful like autumn</p>
<p>But just one drop of creativity<br />
Blends polka into a wild rhythm</p>
<p>Let there be (Let there be, let there be) a shift in mind<br />
Let it be (Let it be, let it be) like a positive shock<br />
The feeling is right, let everyone be overwhelmed by<br />
Native folk rock</p>
<p>These country melodies bring out enthusiasm<br />
Feelings of patriotism, love and pride<br />
And rock spreads energy through guitar strings<br />
Throughout the land like a fire</p>
<p>But a little imagination<br />
Blends rock into the polka rhythm</p>
<p>Let there be (Let there be, let there be) a change of the scene<br />
Let everyone (Let everyone, let everyone) go crazy about this sound<br />
Let it run through their veins, let it strike right into the heart<br />
Native folk rock</p>
