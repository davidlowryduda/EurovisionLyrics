<p>Time changes everything, even you and I have changed<br />
The rain, the winter spring has made us fade away<br />
I still remember everything, that ol&#8217; December, the fears, the cold<br />
I really wonder how you feel on these nights so alone</p>
<p>I hope someday you&#8217;ll see me<br />
I hope someday you&#8217;ll spot me in the crowd<br />
Take my hand and kiss me<br />
I hope someday you&#8217;ll say my name out loud</p>
<p>(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings<br />
Tell me about your stories<br />
Look into my eyes and come on closer<br />
And make me immortal with a kiss</p>
<p>(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings<br />
Tell me about your stories<br />
We know it&#8217;s over, so tell me it&#8217;s over<br />
And life will be better in spring</p>
<p>Time changes everything, but this feeling, it still remains<br />
The sweetest ever lips I&#8217;ve kissed will always feel the same, ooh..</p>
<p>I hope someday you&#8217;ll see me<br />
I hope someday you&#8217;ll spot me in the crowd<br />
Smile and say you miss me<br />
I hope someday you&#8217;ll say my name out loud</p>
<p>(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings<br />
Tell me about your stories<br />
Look into my eyes and come on closer<br />
And make me immortal with a kiss</p>
<p>(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings<br />
Tell me about your stories<br />
We know it&#8217;s over, so tell me it&#8217;s over<br />
And life will be better in spring</p>
<p>(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings<br />
Tell me about your stories<br />
Look into my eyes and come on closer<br />
And make me immortal with a kiss</p>
<p>(Tell me) Tell me about your feelings<br />
Tell me about your stories<br />
We know it&#8217;s over, so tell me it&#8217;s over<br />
And life will be better in spring</p>
