<p>You are like the sunset behind a mountain somewhere<br />
And when I cannot see you I know you&#8217;re still there</p>
<p>Because my heart is yours, I&#8217;ll never leave you<br />
Though we are far apart I&#8217;m by your side<br />
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again<br />
Through it all, now my heart is yours</p>
<p>You say I am the moonlight, I watch you at night<br />
And when you cannot see me I&#8217;m still there in the sky</p>
<p>Because my heart is yours, I&#8217;ll never leave you<br />
Though we are far apart I&#8217;m by your side<br />
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again<br />
Through it all, now my heart is yours</p>
<p>Because my heart is yours, I&#8217;ll never leave you<br />
Though we are far apart I&#8217;m by your side<br />
My love is never gone, I feel it rise again<br />
Through it all, now my heart is yours</p>
