<p>You are my man, you are my half<br />
Tell me what&#8217;s happening<br />
I know something&#8217;s wrong, I can tell when you lie<br />
I can tell you stopped trying</p>
<p>And these last three weeks passed and we barely talked<br />
I think I know and it&#8217;s breaking my heart<br />
Am I in or am I out?</p>
<p>Can I love you forever through this?<br />
Can I trust in you forever through this?<br />
I don&#8217;t know how to stop, how to stop</p>
<p>These tear drop-op-ops<br />
That drip drop, drip drop<br />
Drip drop, drip drop<br />
Whoa, whoa</p>
<p>Tell me, where have you been?<br />
Why are you late? You smell like lipstick again<br />
Come on, answer my question, say something<br />
Why are you acting out? Oh, say it&#8217;s in my head</p>
<p>Can I love you forever through this?<br />
Can I trust in you forever through this?<br />
I don&#8217;t know how to stop, how to stop</p>
<p>These tear drop-op-ops<br />
That drip drop, drip drop<br />
Drip drop, drip drop<br />
Whoa, whoa</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna cry, I don&#8217;t wanna hear your name<br />
If this is where it ends<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna run, run away from myself<br />
And be lost again</p>
<p>(Can I love you forever through this?)<br />
Oh no no no, oh no no no<br />
(Can I trust in you forever through this?)<br />
I don&#8217;t know</p>
<p>These tear drop-op-ops (I don&#8217;t know)<br />
That drip drop, drip drop (I don&#8217;t know)<br />
Drip drop, drip drop<br />
Whoa, whoa</p>
