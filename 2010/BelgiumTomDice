<p>People always say, &#8220;Tom, this has gone too far&#8221;<br />
But I&#8217;m not afraid to chase my dreams, just me and my guitar<br />
And no one may ever know the feelings inside my mind<br />
&#8216;Cause all of the lines I ever write are running out of time</p>
<p>So maybe I should get a 9 to 5<br />
But I don&#8217;t wanna let it go, there&#8217;s so much more to life</p>
<p>Tell me that I got it wrong<br />
Tell me everything will be OK<br />
Before I fall</p>
<p>Tell me they&#8217;ll play my songs<br />
Tell me they&#8217;ll sing the words I&#8217;ll say<br />
When darkness falls</p>
<p>Then all of the stars will see<br />
Just me and my guitar</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;ll find my way, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not afraid to try<br />
But even a world of love and hope can&#8217;t guarantee that prize<br />
So maybe I can get a 9 to 5<br />
And I don&#8217;t wanna let it go, there&#8217;s so much more to life</p>
<p>Tell me that I got it wrong<br />
Tell me everything will be OK<br />
Before I fall</p>
<p>Tell me they&#8217;ll play my songs<br />
Tell me they&#8217;ll sing the words I&#8217;ll say<br />
When darkness falls</p>
<p>Then all of the stars will see<br />
Just me and my guitar, oh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Me and my guitar, mmm&#8230; mmm&#8230;</p>
