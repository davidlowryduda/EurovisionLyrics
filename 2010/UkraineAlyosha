<p>Oh, sweet people<br />
What have we done?<br />
Tell me what is happening?<br />
For all that we&#8217;ve built tumbles and is gone</p>
<p>Oh, sweet people<br />
Have you no love for mankind?<br />
Must you go on killing<br />
Just to pass the time?</p>
<p>The message is so true<br />
The end is really near<br />
All these feelings take me down<br />
It steals the things so dear</p>
<p>Yes, the message is so real<br />
Don&#8217;t turn all the earth to stone<br />
Because, because, because<br />
This is your home</p>
<p>Oh, sweet people<br />
What about our children?<br />
In theatres and video games<br />
They watch what we send to ruin</p>
<p>Oh, sweet people<br />
What senseless game<br />
Have we all been playing?<br />
No one but you to blame</p>
<p>The message is so true<br />
The end is really near<br />
All these feelings take me down<br />
It steals the things so dear</p>
<p>Yes, the message is so real<br />
Don&#8217;t turn all the earth to stone<br />
Because, because, because<br />
This is your home</p>
<p>This is our home</p>
