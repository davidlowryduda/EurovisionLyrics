OPA!</p>
<p>OPA! OPA!</p>
<p>I burnt the past, my old nights<br />
Memories also became shivers<br />
Memories and voices, unjust wishes<br />
And left open wounds in a corner</p>
<p>I burnt the past, my old nights<br />
Dreams and nightmares I threw into flames<br />
Hot tears, too many lies<br />
Seems like a silent movie that I&#8217;m not watching any more</p>
<p>OPA!<br />
I set on fire (Hey!)<br />
All past events (Hey!)<br />
I&#8217;ll change everything (OPA!), and I will cry out (OPA!)<br />
What&#8217;s past is forgotten and everything is starting over</p>
<p>I set on fire (Hey!)<br />
All past events (Hey!)<br />
I&#8217;ll change everything (OPA!), and I will cry out (OPA!)<br />
What&#8217;s past is forgotten and everything is starting over</p>
<p>I burnt the past, my old nights<br />
And I start from scratch even if you don&#8217;t want me to<br />
Hot tears, too many lies<br />
I paid what I owed and borrowed</p>
<p>OPA!<br />
I set on fire (Hey!)<br />
All past events (Hey!)<br />
I&#8217;ll change everything (OPA!), and I will cry out (OPA!)<br />
What&#8217;s past is forgotten and everything is starting over</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Everybody say</em></font> (OPA!)</p>
<p>I set on fire (Hey!)<br />
All past events (Hey!)<br />
I&#8217;ll change everything (OPA!), and I will cry out (OPA!)<br />
What&#8217;s past is forgotten and everything is starting over</p>
<p>I set on fire (Hey!)<br />
All past events (Hey!)<br />
I&#8217;ll change everything (OPA!), and I will cry out (OPA!)<br />
What&#8217;s past is forgotten and everything is starting over</p>
<p>OPA!<br />
