<p>You could be the one in my dreams<br />
You could be much more than you seem<br />
Anything I&#8217;ve wanted in life<br />
Do you understand what I mean?</p>
<p>I can see that this could be fate<br />
I can love you more than they hate<br />
Doesn&#8217;t matter who they will blame<br />
We can beat them at their own game</p>
<p>I can see it in your eyes<br />
It doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise<br />
I&#8217;ve seen you dancing like a star<br />
No matter how different we are</p>
<p>For all this time I&#8217;ve been loving you<br />
Don&#8217;t even know your name<br />
For just one night, we could be the same<br />
No matter what they say</p>
<p>And I feel I&#8217;m turning the page<br />
And I feel the world is a stage<br />
I don&#8217;t think the drama will stop<br />
I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll give up the rage</p>
<p>But I know the world could be great<br />
I can love you more then they hate<br />
Doesn&#8217;t matter who they will blame<br />
We can beat them at their own game</p>
<p>I can see it in your eyes<br />
It doesn&#8217;t come as a surprise<br />
I see you dancing like a star<br />
No matter how different we are</p>
<p>For all this time I&#8217;ve been loving you<br />
Don&#8217;t even know your name<br />
For just one night, we could be the same<br />
No matter what they say</p>
<p>For all this time I&#8217;ve been loving you<br />
Don&#8217;t even know your name<br />
For just one night, we could be the same<br />
No matter what they say</p>
<p>No matter what they say<br />
No matter what they say<br />
We could be the same<br />
No matter what they say</p>
