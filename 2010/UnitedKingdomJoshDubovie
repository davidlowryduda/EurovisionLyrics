<p>How do I begin to imagine<br />
All the happy faces I&#8217;d like to see?<br />
The final destination<br />
With sounds of celebration<br />
If I could find the opportunity</p>
<p>So I wonder, who can I turn to?<br />
Who can make these wishes and dreams come true?<br />
And with you there beside me<br />
And loving hands to guide me<br />
Anything is possible to do</p>
<p>So if you bring the sunshine<br />
I&#8217;ll bring the good times<br />
Just add your laughter, it&#8217;s happy ever after<br />
I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds good to me</p>
<p>I can feel it coming together<br />
All the loving working so very well<br />
There&#8217;s nothing left to do now<br />
I&#8217;m gonna see it through now<br />
And we can let the future write itself</p>
<p>So if you bring the sunshine<br />
I&#8217;ll bring the good times<br />
Just add your laughter, it&#8217;s happy ever after<br />
I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds good to me</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; (Oh whoa whoa yeah&#8230;)</p>
<p>You bring the sunshine<br />
I&#8217;ll bring the good times<br />
Just add your laughter, it&#8217;s happy ever after<br />
I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds good to me<br />
I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds good to me</p>
<p>That sounds good to me</p>
