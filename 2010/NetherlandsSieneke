I&#8217;ve forgotten where I&#8217;ve heard this song, in the summer sun<br />
I believe it was back there with you on the beach in Lisbon<br />
Or was it back there in Paris behind a bowl of fresh mocha ice cream?<br />
Or possibly, it was us two above the sea in an air balloon</p>
<p>Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
I can&#8217;t get it out of my head<br />
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
I get up with it in the morning</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with you<br />
That&#8217;s why I forget so quickly and don&#8217;t know it anymore<br />
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
That&#8217;s roughly how it goes</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love, I&#8217;m in love<br />
I&#8217;m in love, that&#8217;s quite noticeable</p>
<p>Or possibly, I was sitting together with you on a plane to Oslo<br />
Or did it come from a bar in an alley, we were in Trinidad<br />
Or was it with a good glass of wine at that sidewalk cafe in Berlin?<br />
Or was it in Moscow where I&#8217;ve had my first kiss with you?</p>
<p>How can I, how can I&#8230;<br />
How can I, how can I&#8230;<br />
How can I possibly forget that?</p>
<p>Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
I can&#8217;t get it out of my head<br />
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
I get up with it in the morning</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with you<br />
That&#8217;s why I forget so quickly and don&#8217;t know it anymore<br />
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
That&#8217;s roughly how it goes</p>
<p>Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
I can&#8217;t get it out of my head<br />
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
I get up with it in the morning</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with you<br />
That&#8217;s why I forget so quickly and don&#8217;t know it anymore<br />
Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
That&#8217;s roughly how it goes</p>
<p>Shalalee shalala, shalalee shalala<br />
Yes, I remember it again<br />
