<p>Would you believe, Lord of Mercy?<br />
Would you be so good, Lord?<br />
I wanna love her now and I wanna feel that now with all<br />
All of those kisses and sweet embraces</p>
<p>Here am I, lost and forgotten for this cruel, cruel time<br />
When I&#8217;m first time in love (Now that is why)<br />
Now that is why I sing, Lord of Mercy<br />
And I hope now that you hear me, oh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>(What are you doing man?) I&#8217;m looking at her photos<br />
What should I do with them? (Drop them to the fire)<br />
Oh, yes, yes, I&#8217;m gonna burn them now<br />
&#8216;Cause I have to forget her now with all<br />
All of those kisses and sweet embraces</p>
<p>Here am I, lost and forgotten for this cruel, cruel time<br />
When I&#8217;m first time in love (Now that is why)<br />
Now that is why I sing, Lord of Mercy<br />
And I hope now that you hear me, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>(Here am I, lost and forgotten for this cruel, cruel time)<br />
(First time in love, now that is why)<br />
Now that is why I sing, Lord of Mercy<br />
And I hope now that you hear me<br />
Oh, bring her back to me</p>
