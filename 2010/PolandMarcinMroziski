Over the forest, over the mountain<br />
There once lived a knight called &#8220;Peacock Feather&#8221;</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Every day I think about tomorrow<br />
Wanna see my princess much closer<br />
I&#8217;ve decided, never feeling sorrow<br />
I will share my heart when I find her</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;ll be forever, ever and ever<br />
Feeling this love till the day when I die<br />
Being together, even no matter<br />
You didn&#8217;t want me to be by your side</em></font></p>
<p>He kidnapped a girl from the castle<br />
The chase after him was a failure</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Lovely princess, I am here to save you<br />
Take my hand and say that you love me<br />
If you ever say it, even lying<br />
I&#8217;ll let you fly like a bird &#8211; free</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;ll be forever, ever and ever<br />
Feeling this love till the day when I die<br />
Being together, even no matter<br />
You didn&#8217;t want me to be by your side</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I&#8217;ll be forever, ever and ever<br />
Feeling this love till the day when I die<br />
Being together, even no matter<br />
You didn&#8217;t want me to be by your side</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>(I&#8217;ll be forever, ever and ever) I&#8217;ll be forever&#8230;<br />
(Feeling this love till the day when I die)<br />
(Being together, even no matter) No, no, no<br />
(You didn&#8217;t want me to be by your side) You didn&#8217;t want me to be by&#8230;</em></font></p>
<p>(The moral of this is that)<br />
(She didn&#8217;t like the knight) <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Till the day I die&#8230;</em></font><br />
(She didn&#8217;t like the knight)<br />
