<p>I went everywhere for you<br />
I even did my hair for you<br />
I bought new underwear, they blue<br />
And I wore &#8216;em just the other day</p>
<p>Love you, know I&#8217;ll fight for you<br />
I left on the porch light for you<br />
Whether you are sweet or cruel<br />
I&#8217;m gonna love you either way</p>
<p>Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you<br />
&#8216;Cause I, oh, I can&#8217;t go a minute without your love<br />
Like a satellite, I&#8217;m in orbit all the way around you<br />
And I would fall out into the night<br />
Can&#8217;t go a minute without your love</p>
<p>Love, I got it bad for you<br />
I saved the best I have for you<br />
Sometimes make me sad and blue<br />
Wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way</p>
<p>Love, my aim is straight and true<br />
Cupid&#8217;s arrow is just for you<br />
I even painted my toe nails for you<br />
I did it just the other day</p>
<p>Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you<br />
&#8216;Cause I, oh, I can&#8217;t go a minute without your love<br />
Like a satellite I&#8217;m in orbit all the way around you<br />
And I would fall out into the night<br />
Can&#8217;t go a minute without your love</p>
<p>Oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you<br />
&#8216;Cause I, oh, I can&#8217;t go a minute without your love</p>
<p>Where you go, I&#8217;ll follow<br />
You set the pace, we&#8217;ll take it fast and slow<br />
I&#8217;ll follow in your way, oh oh oh</p>
<p>You got me, you got me<br />
A force more powerful then gravity<br />
Its physics, there&#8217;s no escape</p>
<p>Love, my aim is straight and true<br />
Cupid&#8217;s arrow is just for you<br />
I even painted my toe nails for you<br />
I did it just the other day</p>
<p>Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you<br />
&#8216;Cause I, oh, I can&#8217;t go a minute without your love<br />
Like a satellite I&#8217;m in orbit all the way around you<br />
And I would fall out into the night<br />
Can&#8217;t go a minute without your love</p>
<p>Oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you<br />
&#8216;Cause I, oh, I can&#8217;t go a minute without your<br />
Love, oh, love, love, love, love</p>
