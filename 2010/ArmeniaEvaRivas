<p>Many, many years ago, when I was a little child<br />
Mama told me you should know our world is cruel and wild<br />
But to make your way through cold and heat<br />
Love is all that you need</p>
<p>I believed her every word, more than anything I heard<br />
But I was too scared to lose my fun<br />
I began to cry a lot and she gave me apricots<br />
Kisses of the earth, fruits of the sun</p>
<p>Apricot stone, hidden in my hand<br />
Given back to me from the motherland<br />
Apricot stone, I will drop it down in the frozen ground<br />
I&#8217;ll just let it make its round</p>
<p>Apricot stone, hidden in my hand<br />
Given back to me from the motherland<br />
Apricot stone</p>
<p>Now I see the Northern stars shining brightly in the storm<br />
And I&#8217;ve got an avatar of my love to keep me warm<br />
Now I&#8217;m not afraid of violent winds<br />
They may blow &#8211; they can&#8217;t win</p>
<p>May the winter stay away from my harvest night and day<br />
May God bless and keep my cherished fruit<br />
Grow my tree up to the sky, once I waved my home goodbye<br />
I just want to go back to my roots</p>
<p>Apricot stone, hidden in my hand<br />
Given back to me from the motherland<br />
Apricot stone, I will drop it down in the frozen ground<br />
I&#8217;ll just let it make its round</p>
<p>Apricot stone, hidden in my hand<br />
Given back to me from the motherland<br />
Apricot stone, hidden in my hand<br />
Given back to me from the motherland<br />
Apricot stone</p>
