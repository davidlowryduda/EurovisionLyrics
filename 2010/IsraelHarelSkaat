<p>The sadness is here again, the fear is here again<br />
And the end embroidered in my window<br />
Cracked glass panel and silence again<br />
Weary and discarded in my imagination</p>
<p>The light fell asleep, tears of blood scorch my throat<br />
Scratched handle, sloping ceiling<br />
When I sing to you the last song</p>
<p>You left me only words, shelter between the shadows<br />
Tidy books, and between the rooms<br />
You left me only words, wreath of locks<br />
Oh God, you left me only words</p>
<p>Walls are silent now, and what have you taken when you run away?<br />
Yes, what have you taken?<br />
In this war you might have won<br />
And what I was left with when you went away?</p>
<p>You left me only words, shelter between the shadows<br />
Tidy books, and between the rooms<br />
You left me only words, wreath of locks<br />
Oh God, you left me only words</p>
<p>You left me only words, shelter between the shadows<br />
Tidy books, and between the rooms<br />
You left me only words, wreath of locks<br />
Oh God, you left me only words</p>
<p>And even the ice feels cold, when I remember<br />
How today you&#8217;re in front of him, lighted in his shade<br />
Breaks down for him, the words you&#8217;ve left me<br />
You&#8217;re now telling him</p>
<p>You left me only words, shelter between the shadows<br />
Tidy books, and between the rooms<br />
You left me only words, wreath of locks<br />
Oh God, you left me only words</p>
<p>Tidy books, and between the rooms<br />
You left me only words, wreath of locks<br />
Oh God, you left me only words<br />
