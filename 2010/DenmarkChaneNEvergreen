<p>For as long as I remember<br />
For as long as I&#8217;ve been blue<br />
Every day since we&#8217;ve been parted<br />
All I&#8217;ve thought about was you</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t need the time for sorrow<br />
Didn&#8217;t need the time for pain<br />
What am I supposed to do when living without you<br />
Was the worst I ever knew?</p>
<p>In a moment like this<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you&#8217;re looking for<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know, could you ask for more?</p>
<p>Oh, in a moment like this<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you<br />
Oh, in a moment like this</p>
<p>Ever since the day you left me<br />
Ooh&#8230; ever since you went away<br />
I&#8217;m lost and I don&#8217;t know, where am I supposed to go?<br />
I still miss you so</p>
<p>In a moment like this<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you&#8217;re looking for<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know, could you ask for more?<br />
Oh, in a moment like this</p>
<p>When I need for you hold me<br />
Say you&#8217;ll love and never leave me<br />
My heart will forever be true</p>
<p>In a moment like this<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what you&#8217;re looking for<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know, could you ask for more?</p>
<p>Oh, in a moment like this<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know what I have to do<br />
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know how to get to you<br />
Oh, in a moment like this</p>
