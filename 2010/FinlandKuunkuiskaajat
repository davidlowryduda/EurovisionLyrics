What do I sing when I&#8217;m happy?<br />
What do I put on top of floating melodies?<br />
Lots of sunshine and white clouds<br />
Laughing eyes for market vendors</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>What do I sing when I&#8217;m unhappy?<br />
What do my melodies have to bear?<br />
Rain and stormy weather over the city<br />
I&#8217;ll give a penny to the troubador with holes in his trousers</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>What do I sing when I&#8217;m in love?<br />
Will my love carry the song to the moon?<br />
Just velvet, silk and golden thread<br />
From those is sewn my darlings shirt</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>What do I sing when I&#8217;m walking alone?<br />
I wonder why do I keep writing new songs?<br />
Two strange birds already fly on the horizon<br />
Flying when it&#8217;s time to finish singing</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading</p>
<p>I sing<br />
Shine, sun, walk your route dear moon<br />
One lives by working too, but gets rich by trading<br />
