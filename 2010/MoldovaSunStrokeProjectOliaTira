<p>Oh&#8230; forget, let me breathe, let me live<br />
Just run away from my mind<br />
Oh&#8230; forgive, I don&#8217;t need, I won&#8217;t breathe<br />
Just get away from my life</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve lost one and all, so fly away<br />
Over the clouds, under the sky<br />
Never come back and run away<br />
With all your might, give up you</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe anymore your shallow heart<br />
I know that it&#8217;s you who chose to play this trick<br />
I&#8217;ll never forgive you, not for anything<br />
And now you are left with nothing</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; forget, let me breathe, let me live<br />
Just run away from my mind<br />
Oh&#8230; forgive, I don&#8217;t need, I won&#8217;t breathe<br />
Just get away from my life</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; forget, let me breathe, let me live<br />
Just run away from my mind<br />
Oh&#8230; forgive, I don&#8217;t need, I won&#8217;t breathe<br />
Just get away from my life</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no other time to making happiness<br />
You have mistaken<br />
We have no progressive future<br />
I know your lying nature</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no other time to making happiness<br />
You have mistaken<br />
We have no progressive future<br />
I know your lying nature</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; forget, let me breathe, let me live<br />
Just run away from my mind<br />
Oh&#8230; forgive, I don&#8217;t need, I won&#8217;t breathe<br />
Just get away from my life</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; forget, let me breathe, let me live<br />
Just run away from my mind<br />
Oh&#8230; forgive, I don&#8217;t need, I won&#8217;t breathe<br />
Just get away from my life</p>
