A new day is waking<br />
But the rain will come to us again<br />
The gravestone by me is you</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t touch these lips of mine, that isn&#8217;t you<br />
Leave me to dream, though a dream without you is just a dream</p>
<p>I have the strength to get over you<br />
To not have you and to not see you<br />
And I spread my wings to fly over you<br />
Through all, through all the heavens</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to feel the warm wind on my face again<br />
It&#8217;s good to be free and alone, free and alone</p>
<p>I have the strength to get over you<br />
To not have you and to not see you<br />
And I spread my wings to fly over you<br />
Through all, through all the heavens</p>
<p>A day is waking, a new day, a new problem<br />
You&#8217;re here with me, but again I&#8217;m lonely<br />
I&#8217;m running from everything, even running from you<br />
Little woman I just need to be by myself</p>
<p>I want to dream, I wanted to dream<br />
But a dream with you is only a dream<br />
And I have the strength to realise that you were never mine, ha</p>
<p>I have the strength to get over you<br />
To not have you and to not see you<br />
And I spread my wings to fly over you<br />
Through all, through all the heavens</p>
<p>I have the strength to get over you<br />
To not have you and to not see you<br />
And I spread my wings<br />
Through all the heavens<br />
