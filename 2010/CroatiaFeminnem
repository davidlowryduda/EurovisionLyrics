Easy, everything is easy<br />
Whenever I have you<br />
Trust me, wherever I am I know that I&#8217;m yours<br />
You can see it by the glow in my eyes</p>
<p>Easy, everything is easy<br />
Because you&#8217;re not leaving me<br />
When I&#8217;m not smiling at you I know I&#8217;m making a mistake<br />
Because I&#8217;m just a woman who surrenders</p>
<p>With my last shred of strength now I&#8217;m standing here in front of you<br />
My soul is being torn up by storms of unrest<br />
It&#8217;s harder to come to terms with this pain<br />
Because you&#8217;ve been cheated on and it&#8217;s killing me</p>
<p>Easy, everything is easy<br />
Because you know me best<br />
While I&#8217;m standing here before you, you can see that I&#8217;m scared<br />
Because betrayal is written on my face</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m standing here before you, you can see that I&#8217;m scared<br />
Please forgive me, I love you, really love you<br />
I can&#8217;t live without you, I&#8217;m no longer myself<br />
I&#8217;m no longer myself</p>
<p>Believe me wherever I am I know that I&#8217;m yours<br />
You can see it by the glow in my eyes<br />
Easy, everything is easy<br />
