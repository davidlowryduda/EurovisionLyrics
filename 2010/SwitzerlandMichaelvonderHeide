On the horizon, a touch of silver<br />
Like after a storm, the clouds disappear<br />
The summer nights, forgotten dreams<br />
Thanks to your perfume, I find my way back</p>
<p>It&#8217;s raining gold, each time you talk to me about love<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold, let&#8217;s leave together for the big journey<br />
Under the starry vault, destinies are golden<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold</p>
<p>And in the morning, shared secret<br />
Exchanging glances, accomplice of summer<br />
The day chases magic, the shimmering eyes remain</p>
<p>It&#8217;s raining gold, each time you talk to me about love (It&#8217;s raining gold)<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold, let&#8217;s leave together for the big journey<br />
Under the starry vault, destinies are golden<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold, the whole night and until the dawn<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold</p>
<p>Dance with me, fly with me<br />
Speak quietly, speak with me</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s raining gold) It&#8217;s raining gold<br />
(It&#8217;s raining gold)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s raining gold, let&#8217;s leave together for the big journey<br />
Under the starry vault, destinies are golden<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold, the whole night and until the dawn<br />
It&#8217;s raining gold<br />
