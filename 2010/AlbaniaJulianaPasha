<p>You are the one, you give me that something I need<br />
It&#8217;s me, and I&#8217;m calling<br />
You are the one, making it easy to be<br />
In love with you I&#8217;m falling</p>
<p>We been down<br />
But don&#8217;t you know we been down here<br />
And I feel it, even now<br />
Time that we make a deal and seal it</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about you, the things that I do<br />
The rest of the world don&#8217;t understand me<br />
You&#8217;re all that I dream, everything that I need<br />
&#8216;Cause when you are gone, I feel so empty</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in the way you look at me<br />
You&#8217;re driving me crazy<br />
It&#8217;s all about you, all the things that I do<br />
You are my life, &#8217;cause you make it amazing</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the one who doesn&#8217;t know how to say no<br />
To you I&#8217;m so easy<br />
I&#8217;m the one, who&#8217;s letting my ego just go<br />
For you complete me</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been down<br />
But something tells me it&#8217;s only getting better<br />
So stick around, I wanna know what it feels like<br />
Forever and ever</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about you, the things that I do<br />
The rest of the world don&#8217;t understand me<br />
You&#8217;re all that I dream, everything that I need<br />
&#8216;Cause when you are gone, I feel so empty</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in the way you look at me<br />
You&#8217;re driving me crazy<br />
It&#8217;s all about you, all the things that I do<br />
You are my life &#8217;cause you make it amazing</p>
<p>I&#8217;m never alone with the loving you give me<br />
Wherever I go, I&#8217;m hoping you miss me<br />
Don&#8217;t wanna ever go back, never ever go back<br />
Baby you&#8217;re my destiny, oh yeah</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about you, the things that I do<br />

&#8216;Cause when you are gone, I feel so empty</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in the way you look at me<br />
