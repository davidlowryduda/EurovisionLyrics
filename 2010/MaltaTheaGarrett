<p>We used to say that dreams could be so true<br />
Where am I? What will I be?<br />
It&#8217;s my dream which I could share with you<br />
A new day for you and me</p>
<p>Just a smile with warmth in my heart and go all the way<br />
There&#8217;s so much in life and I&#8217;ll sing</p>
<p>This is my dream, I want to make it really happen<br />
And make my dream come true<br />
This is my dream, I&#8217;ll make it if I just believe it<br />
In a fairytale I&#8217;ll live it, just like a new born star</p>
<p>Fly above like a seagull on the waves<br />
And the sun will shine upon your face<br />
Just believe, follow your heart and make it happen<br />
Grow much brighter and we&#8217;ll say</p>
<p>This is my dream, I want to make it really happen<br />
And make my dream come true<br />
This is my dream, I&#8217;ll make it if I just believe it<br />
There is nothing that could stop me<br />
I just want the world to know</p>
<p>This is my dream, and I know that I&#8217;ll be strong<br />
It will come true because I know I&#8217;ll make it happen<br />
This is my dream</p>
