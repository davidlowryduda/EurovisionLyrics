No more &#8211; no less, when I can see you closer<br />
Just let me be here &#8211; because once I&#8217;ve stayed with you I want it like this now<br />
But still my fear is:</p>
<p>When time goes by, the clock strikes too much again<br />
Soon the night has ended, everyday work rebegins<br />
When time goes by, soon I can see it:<br />
I don&#8217;t find you next to me, oh, why does time run so fast?</p>
<p>No more &#8211; no less, when I can see you closer<br />
Just let me be here &#8211; because once I&#8217;ve stayed with you I want it like this now<br />
But still my fear is:</p>
<p>When time goes by, and it would bring a pale morning<br />
The stars wouldn&#8217;t shine, you fly away with them<br />
When time goes by, I get older along with it<br />
The time of love is left&#8230; ph, why can&#8217;t the clocks &#8211; stop?</p>
