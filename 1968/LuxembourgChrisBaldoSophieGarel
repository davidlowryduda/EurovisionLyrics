By being wrong to chase away boredom<br />
The time of loving and of skies of rain<br />
Withered flowers or faded hearts<br />
We see too many of those in life</p>
<p>But you and me, we&#8217;ll live on love<br />
Without making a step to a few detours<br />
Yes, you and me, we&#8217;ll live on love<br />
Happy until the last day</p>
<p>I read my life in the depth of your eyes<br />
And there I see myself always happier<br />
I know that others have known these joys<br />
And have cried more than once</p>
<p>But you and me, we&#8217;ll live on love<br />
Without making a step towards a few detours<br />
Yes, you and me, we&#8217;ll live on love<br />
Happy until the last day</p>
<p>Yes, you and me, we&#8217;ll live on love<br />
We have the right to always love each other<br />
We have the right to believe in love<br />
Both of us, until the last day</p>
<p>Yes, you and me, we&#8217;ll live on love<br />
We have the right to always love each other<br />
