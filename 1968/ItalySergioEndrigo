Marianne, you make me happy for a moment<br />
Then I don&#8217;t live any longer, Marianne</p>
<p>What is that great wish that you have to run for?<br />
You never stop here with me</p>
<p>Where are you going? Where do you come from, my love?<br />
There where you&#8217;re going, stay next to me for a while<br />
If you are selling your dreams for dreaming<br />
Maybe your youth is desperate</p>
<p>Marianne, you love the flowers and you&#8217;ll never realise<br />
That I love you, Marianne</p>
<p>Marianne</p>
<p>Where are you going? Where do you come from, my love?<br />
There where you are going, stay next to me for a while<br />
If you are selling your dreams for dreaming<br />
Maybe your youth is desperate</p>
<p>Marianne, you love the flowers and you&#8217;ll never realise<br />
That I love you, Marianne</p>
<p>Marianne, Marianne<br />
