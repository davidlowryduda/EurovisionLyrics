<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Like an ending to everything<br />
Like a stone rolling from a crag<br />
Like a smoke rising in the air</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost indifferent<br />
Walking by, without looking to people<br />
That I watch passing me by</p>
<p>The summer is over<br />
It was a dream that ended<br />
I won&#8217;t think about it</p>
<p>Therefore I leave this sadness<br />
Drifting, rocked, by being certain<br />
That the summer will return</p>
<p>And the summer that I long to come near<br />
Will surely bring me<br />
What this summer took away<br />
