(La lalala lalala lalala&#8230;)</p>
<p>I sing to the morning which sees my youth<br />
And to the sun that brings us new hope day by day<br />
Everything in life is like a song<br />
Which is sung when you were born and also on your farewell</p>
<p>La lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lalala lalala la&#8230;<br />
La lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lalala lalala la&#8230;</p>
<p>I sing to my mother who gave me my life<br />
I sing to the earth which has seen me growing<br />
And I sing to the day when I felt love<br />
Walking through life I learned this song</p>
<p>La lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lalala lalala la&#8230;<br />
La lalala lalala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lalala lalala la&#8230;<br />
