<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
When you will come back, you who have left me<br />
You who are so far away from me<br />
A bird will tell me: &#8220;Sing your bliss&#8221;</p>
<p>When you will come back, hasting you over there<br />
Along our ancient roads<br />
Showing your colours in the merlons of my heart</p>
<p>Weeks passing by, the days are lingering<br />
And I&#8217;m waiting for your return<br />
Spinning the wool in my beautiful finery<br />
Embroiding my pain in soft threads of love</p>
<p>When you will come back, you who have left me<br />
With a lot of hope in front of me<br />
My love is waiting for you nearby a wood fire</p>
<p>Watch my tenderness on your standard<br />
But before seeing you back<br />
Me, poor princess, my heart in black<br />
I&#8217;m turning incessantly my spinning wheel of hope</p>
<p>Because you will come back without ever leaving me again<br />
And my heart will be satisfied<br />
Because I love you, because I love you<br />
