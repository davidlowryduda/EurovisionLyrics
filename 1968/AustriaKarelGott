Now the city wears an evening dress<br />
A sea of lights in the darkness<br />
The loneliness enters in every house at this time</p>
<p>We live like we&#8217;re on little islands<br />
You even don&#8217;t know who lives next to you<br />
You all, you don&#8217;t know each other<br />
In the same world of noise and lights</p>
<p>Many thousands of windows shine bright in this city<br />
And you ask yourself: Who might be behind them?<br />
Many thousands of windows say silently: here still lives somebody<br />
As lonesome and alone as you</p>
<p>Could that human over there be the one<br />
Of whom you are dreaming year after year?<br />
Who might be your home?<br />
But you are separated from him by a sea of houses</p>
<p>Tomorrow your heart is still empty<br />
Then you are still hoping<br />
That you are not alone<br />
In this grey world of steel and stone</p>
<p>Many thousands of windows shine bright in this city<br />
And you ask yourself: who might be behind them?<br />
Many thousands of windows say silently: Here still lives somebody<br />
As lonesome and alone as you<br />
