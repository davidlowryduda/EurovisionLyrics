The day before yesterday I suddenly turned down the guys<br />
When they invited me to a party<br />
And then I spent a whole evening conversing<br />
With your mother, being polite</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look like love, darn it<br />
The kind of thing you see in the movies, imagine that<br />
I guess I&#8217;m suspicious, but the thought crops up<br />
But by all means, I could be wrong</p>
<p>Last night I went with you and watched a tearjerker<br />
Although I wanted to watch &#8216;bang-bang&#8217;<br />
And then I sat listening to a string quartet<br />
Me, I only used to like &#8216;twang-twang&#8217;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look like love, darn it<br />
The kind of thing you read about in books, imagine that<br />
I don&#8217;t understand it, I guess I&#8217;m a little stupid<br />
But by all means, I could be wrong</p>
<p>This morning I sang as I brushed my teeth<br />
And then I began working like crazy<br />
And then I called you about nothing at all<br />
Just because I suddenly felt like it</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look like love, darn it<br />
The kind of thing that happens to others, imagine that<br />
It all indicates, that I&#8217;m in love and all that<br />
But by all means, I could be wrong</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look like love, darn it<br />
The kind of thing that happens to others, imagine that<br />
It all indicates, that I&#8217;m in love and all that<br />
But by all means, I could be wrong<br />
I could be wrong<br />
