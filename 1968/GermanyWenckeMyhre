A toast to love, long live love<br />
Three cheers for love, long live love<br />
Which keeps our world so young</p>
<p>It was the first time, maybe I got it wrong then<br />
It was the second time that you really confused me<br />
But the third time I knew right away where it was headed<br />
And then, the fourth time I felt it for sure</p>
<p>A toast to love, long live love<br />
Three cheers for love, long live love<br />
Which keeps our world so young</p>
<p>A toast to love, long live love<br />
Three cheers for love, long live love<br />
Which keeps our world so young</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the first time for me, and it&#8217;s only because of you<br />
That&#8217;s the first time for me that I&#8217;ve been able to say:</p>
<p>A toast to love, long live love<br />
Three cheers for love, long live love<br />
Which keeps our world so young</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how it is every time with you, and it&#8217;s only because of you<br />
That for the next time with you I can hardly wait<br />
Because the first time I already knew where it was headed<br />
That there&#8217;d never be a last time for us</p>
<p>Lalalala lalalala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lalalala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala lalalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Love, love, which keeps our world so young</p>
<p>Since the world is turning<br />
Wherever your lucky star may be<br />
Wherever the wind may drift you</p>
<p>A toast to love, long live love<br />
Three cheers for love, long live love<br />
Which always blooms, wherever you look<br />
Which keeps our world so young<br />
