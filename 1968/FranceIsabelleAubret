The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder<br />
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there</p>
<p>She was blonde, she was gentle<br />
She liked to rest<br />
In the wood, lying down on the moss<br />
Listening to the birds singing</p>
<p>One day she was going to town<br />
Through the woods, that she passed by<br />
She suddenly saw, motionless<br />
Three men looking at her<br />
Three men looking at her</p>
<p>The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder<br />
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there</p>
<p>They were three, there, waiting for her<br />
Three men-wolves, this lamb<br />
Her flesh was much too tender<br />
They had too much appetite</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t know how to defend<br />
The fragile breath of her life<br />
She fell down on the soft grass<br />
Like a bird falls from the nest<br />
Like a bird falls from the nest</p>
<p>The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder<br />
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there</p>
<p>When they picked her up from the ground<br />
Like a big cut flower<br />
Her white dress and the light<br />
She looked like a bride</p>
<p>When they picked her up from the ground<br />
She looked like a big lily<br />
Among the leaves, among the rocks<br />
A pure source gushed out<br />
A pure source gushed out</p>
<p>The source sings in the middle of the wood, and I wonder<br />
If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there</p>
<p>If I should believe this legend of a girl they found there<br />
