<p>One day, while I was out walking<br />
I saw your face in the midst of a crowd<br />
Here, I thought, is the chance of a lifetime<br />
I thought you&#8217;d stepped from a cloud</p>
<p>Think of that wonderful meeting<br />
Oh, the sun shone down on us from above<br />
Why should I be out walking that day and get<br />
The chance of a lifetime of love?</p>
<p>Show me the way you are feeling<br />
Always tell me just what I should know<br />
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together<br />
But now that seems so long ago</p>
<p>You are the one I have dreamt of<br />
Oh, I never thought my dreams would come true<br />
All I want is the chance of a lifetime<br />
The chance of a lifetime with you</p>
<p>Show me the way you are feeling<br />
Always tell me just what I should know<br />
Oh, a guiding hand must have brought us together<br />
But now that seems so long ago</p>
<p>You are the one I have dreamt of<br />
I never thought my dreams would come true<br />
All I want is the chance of a lifetime<br />
The chance of a lifetime with you</p>
<p>All I want is the chance of a lifetime<br />
The chance of a lifetime with you</p>
