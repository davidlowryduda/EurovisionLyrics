To everyone his song, we want to sing about love<br />
Every refrain is our everyday story<br />
Whether it cries or laughs isn&#8217;t very important<br />
What counts, in my opinion, is being two</p>
<p>Two in a song, two who play with love<br />
Where one leaves without reason and the other awaits the return</p>
<p>To everyone his song, we want to sing about love<br />
Unforced refrains, full of sentiments around them<br />
I&#8217;m like the lovers of my refrains<br />
Whether it cries or laughs like them, that doesn&#8217;t matter</p>
<p>The important thing is to love, to give everything, but in return<br />
You meet yourself again in the heart of a refrain of love</p>
<p>La lala lala lala&#8230;<br />
La lala lala lalalala lala&#8230;</p>
<p>To everyone his song, we want to sing about love<br />
Every refrain is our everyday story<br />
Unforced refrains, full of sentiments around them<br />
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love</p>
<p>(To everyone his song, everyone his song of love)<br />
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love<br />
(To everyone his song, everyone his song of love)<br />
To everyone his song, everyone his song of love<br />
