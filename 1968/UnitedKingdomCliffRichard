<p>Congratulations and celebrations<br />
When I tell everyone that you&#8217;re in love with me<br />
Congratulations and jubilations<br />
I want the world to know I&#8217;m happy as can be</p>
<p>Who would believe that I could be happy and contented?<br />
I used to think that happiness hadn&#8217;t been invented<br />
But that was in the bad old days before I met you<br />
Or when I let you walk into my heart</p>
<p>Congratulations and celebrations<br />
When I tell everyone that you&#8217;re in love with me<br />
Congratulations and jubilations<br />
I want the world to know I&#8217;m happy as can be</p>
<p>I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me<br />
That I was only fooling myself to think you&#8217;d love me<br />
But then tonight you said you couldn&#8217;t live without me<br />
That round about me, you wanted to stay</p>
<p>Congratulations and celebrations<br />
When I tell everyone that you&#8217;re in love with me<br />
Congratulations and jubilations<br />
I want the world to know I&#8217;m happy as can be</p>
<p>Congratulations and jubilations<br />
I want the world to know I&#8217;m happy as can be</p>
<p>I want the world to know I&#8217;m happy as can be</p>
