Today I want to go out, it&#8217;s night, I can&#8217;t sleep<br />
I have to call you &#8211; friends, what are they for?<br />
Not one time you&#8217;ve stopped listening to me<br />
Today I want to thank you, nothing else</p>
<p>Listen to me, you&#8217;re not alone; listen to me, you are loved<br />
Listen to me, you can hear me, I&#8217;m singing, singing<br />
What will you think? &#8211; oh, it&#8217;s late to call<br />
You can change, if you want, I can pick you up</p>
<p>Now my city is passing by behind the glass<br />
One more traffic light, I listen to the radio, I listen to the radio<br />
This is your house, I make a sign<br />
You&#8217;re already here</p>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;re here, as always, without asking<br />
Your smile as one more sign &#8211; friends, what are they for?<br />
Yes, you&#8217;re here, and that&#8217;s what matters for me<br />
You&#8217;ll tell me again: friends, what are they for?</p>
<p>Listen to me, you&#8217;re not alone; listen to me, you are loved<br />
Listen to me, you can hear me, I&#8217;m singing, singing<br />
Now my city is passing by behind the glass<br />
One more traffic light, I listen to the radio, I listen to the radio</p>
<p>Listen to me, you&#8217;re not alone; listen to me, you are loved<br />
Listen to me, you can hear me, I&#8217;m singing, singing<br />
I&#8217;m singing, singing<br />
