<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Just like a star, posing when the lights flash<br />
Your style is like Garbo, glitter on your jacket<br />
Whatever you do is for fame and money<br />
See what you are missing, joy is somewhere else</p>
<p>And I tell you stop, don&#8217;t, life is rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
Stop, don&#8217;t, just think for a second<br />
Stop, don&#8217;t, let&#8217;s start all over again<br />
Look, it&#8217;s not too late</p>
<p>You go around in discos, talking about cinema<br />
A life full of risk, champagne, parties, secrets<br />
Whatever you do is for fame and money<br />
See what you are missing, joy is somewhere else</p>
<p>And I tell you stop, don&#8217;t, life is rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
Stop, don&#8217;t, just think for a second<br />
Stop, don&#8217;t, let&#8217;s start all over again<br />
Look, it&#8217;s not too late</p>
<p>And I tell you stop, don&#8217;t, life is rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
Stop, don&#8217;t, just think for a second<br />
Stop, don&#8217;t, let&#8217;s start all over again<br />
Look, it&#8217;s not too late</p>
<p>Stop<br />
