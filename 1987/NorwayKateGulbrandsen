Now the limelight has been lit, a voice whispers anxiously<br />
What have I to say?<br />
Will I dare to walk forward? Do I dare to meet them?<br />
Do I have enough to give?</p>
<p>I have to seize the chance now<br />
But can I trust myself, my life?</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m standing in front of a road, only I can walk<br />
A future in my hands<br />
And a goal only I can catch<br />
No one can take my dream away from me, it is my life</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for answers<br />
All the thoughts I have, make me doubt<br />
But that won&#8217;t stop me<br />
I want to go my own way and I dare to say</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s me it&#8217;s all about<br />
Now I&#8217;m going to trust myself, my life</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m standing in front of a road, only I can walk<br />
A future in my hands<br />
And a goal only I can catch<br />
No one can take my dream away from me</p>
<p>In front of a road, only I can walk<br />
A future in my hands<br />
And a goal only I can reach<br />
No one can take away from me<br />
No one can take away my dream from me</p>
<p>My dream<br />
