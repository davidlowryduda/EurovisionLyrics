I remember seeing you on the train<br />
And you said that you wanted me to wait for you<br />
Then you just vanished<br />
I look for something to bring us together<br />
But only a picture is left for me, yeah, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>White, black, I dream you are coming back to me<br />
White, black, I play the piano and you smile<br />
And as I touch the key I feel like flying<br />
White, black, I dream I&#8217;ll see you again</p>
<p>I see your face in the mirror<br />
As a star falls in the night<br />
A wish we&#8217;ll be together<br />
My dream always comes true<br />
With a song, a sweet ballad, yeah, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>White, black, I dream you are coming back to me<br />
White, black, I play the piano and you smile<br />
And as I touch the key I feel like flying<br />
White, black, I dream I&#8217;ll see you again</p>
<p>I close my eyes, I want to find myself by your side<br />
And as I wake up, my dream comes true</p>
<p>White, black, I dream you are coming back to me<br />
White, black, I play the piano and you smile<br />
And as I touch the key I feel like flying<br />
White, black, I dream I&#8217;ll see you again<br />
