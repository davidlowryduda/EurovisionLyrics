<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The earth is yours and mine<br />
Ooh, the place we love<br />
Take good care of it, that&#8217;s a common matter</p>
<p>It takes more<br />
Than just saying we know<br />
Try with this song</p>
<p>It was a little tune we sing here<br />
But just sing along and see what happens<br />
Together we could be the biggest choir<br />
A song can become more than you think</p>
<p>No matter who we are<br />
And no matter where we live<br />
We&#8217;ve all borrowed the same earth, ooh yeah</p>
<p>But remember<br />
Still it always starts with yourself<br />
Try once, ooh, with this song</p>
<p>It was a little tune, an easy refrain<br />
That can be sung over and over, ooh yeah, again<br />
Together we could be the biggest choir<br />
A song can become more than you think</p>
<p>(Sing a song a be everybody&#8217;s friend) Oh yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
(Let us sing again) Oh whoa yeah&#8230;<br />
(Sing a song about a better earth)<br />
(It helps more than you think)</p>
<p>It was a little tune, an easy refrain<br />
That can be sung over and over, ooh yeah, again<br />
Together we could be the biggest choir<br />
A song can become more than you think<br />
