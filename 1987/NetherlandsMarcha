When the door fell shut a shivering went here through the house<br />
And the trembling went very deeply into my heart<br />
Oh, it knocked me out, I almost counted myself out<br />
And the value of being happy was adjusted<br />
And the clock always ticked the word &#8216;over&#8217;</p>
<p>But upright in the wind<br />
I&#8217;ll remain standing<br />
I&#8217;ll go on, just believe me<br />
Whether it&#8217;s with or without you</p>
<p>Upright in the wind<br />
Even if it&#8217;s a hurricane<br />
If you can no longer find any solid ground<br />
I&#8217;ll still stand upright in the wind<br />
(Upright in the wind)</p>
<p>When the door fell shut I told myself: &#8220;Don&#8217;t look back no more&#8221;<br />
Raise the bridge, make a fortress of your heart<br />
And restrain your tears, save them for the night<br />
When you&#8217;re still hoping and waiting in the wild darkness<br />
But that&#8217;ll pass over, once that&#8217;ll go over too</p>
<p>But upright in the wind<br />
I&#8217;ll remain standing<br />
I&#8217;ll go on, just believe me<br />
Whether it&#8217;s with or without you</p>
<p>Upright in the wind<br />
Even if it&#8217;s a hurricane<br />
If you can no longer find any solid ground<br />
I&#8217;ll still stand upright in the wind</p>
<p>If you can no longer find any solid ground<br />
I&#8217;ll still stand upright in the wind<br />
(Upright in the wind) Upright in the wind<br />
(Upright in the wind) Upright in the wind<br />
