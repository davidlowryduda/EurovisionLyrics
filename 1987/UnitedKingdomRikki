<p>It&#8217;s only the light<br />
That fades through the night<br />
A shadow has fallen<br />
And the darkness, it&#8217;s callin&#8217;<br />
Ho&#8230;</p>
<p>Shadows walkin&#8217; behind me<br />
Strange lights, won&#8217;t let them blind me<br />
Voices runnin&#8217; on through my mind<br />
Survival, got to get on with life</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the light<br />
That fades through the night<br />
A shadow has fallen<br />
And the darkness, it&#8217;s callin&#8217;<br />
It&#8217;s only the light after me</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the light, I can see the light<br />
It&#8217;s only the light, can&#8217;t you see the light?<br />
It&#8217;s only the light, only light</p>
<p>Mirrors, I see your reflection<br />
Moving in every direction<br />
I can&#8217;t see, it seems so confusing<br />
So touch me, remove this illusion</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the light<br />
That glows in the night<br />
The spirit that moves me<br />
The spirit that moves free<br />
It&#8217;s only the light after me</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the light, I can see the light<br />
It&#8217;s only the light, can&#8217;t you see the light?<br />
It&#8217;s only the light, only light</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the light, I can see the light<br />
It&#8217;s only the light, can&#8217;t you see the light?<br />
It&#8217;s only the light, only light</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the light</p>
