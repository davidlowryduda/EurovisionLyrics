In my country, there&#8217;s a river that runs non-stop<br />
In my country, there&#8217;s a ship that doesn&#8217;t always go out to sea<br />
In my country, sadness is called loneliness<br />
In my country, beauty is invented in my hand</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sailing an empty boat<br />
That crosses the river to the dock of longing<br />
I&#8217;m sailing on a very beautiful wave<br />
In this ageless sailing boat</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sailing an overfull boat<br />
In the middle of the path of hope<br />
I&#8217;m sailing on a very beautiful wave<br />
In this sailing boat with a childish look</p>
<p>In my country, there&#8217;s a river that runs non-stop<br />
In my country, there&#8217;s a ship that doesn&#8217;t always go out to sea<br />
My country is a sun of anger and flowers<br />
Even tough it has dark eyes that are waiting for me</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sailing an overfull boat<br />
In the middle of the path of hope<br />
I&#8217;m sailing on a very beautiful wave<br />
In this sailing boat with a childish look</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sailing an overfull boat<br />
In the middle of the path of hope<br />
