Little quiet girl, little fragile girl<br />
She asks to be loved with a persistent &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
The passion deep down her sky-blue eyes<br />
She speaks very quietly, listen to her</p>
<p>The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Why restrain them? They come from the heart<br />
The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Magical music from the heart for happiness</p>
<p>I look like her and I shiver like her<br />
I still want to dream, I still want to hope<br />
The passion deep down her sky-blue eyes<br />
A bit of warmth, no more fear</p>
<p>The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Why restrain them? They come from the heart<br />
The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Magical music from the heart for happiness</p>
<p>You must say what you feel<br />
Otherwise it&#8217;s not easy to understand you<br />
Do as the child who is not cheating<br />
When he loves, he holds out his arms to you<br />
So don&#8217;t forget</p>
<p>The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Why restrain them? They come from the heart<br />
The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Magical music from the heart for happiness</p>
<p>The words of love don&#8217;t have a Sunday<br />
Magical music from the heart for happiness<br />
