<p>Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t close your heart to how you feel<br />
Dream, and don&#8217;t be afraid the dream&#8217;s not real<br />
Close your eyes, pretend it&#8217;s just the two of us again<br />
Make believe this moment&#8217;s here to stay</p>
<p>Touch, touch me the way you used to do<br />
I know tonight could be all I&#8217;ll have with you<br />
From now on, you&#8217;ll be with someone else instead of me<br />
So tonight, let&#8217;s fill this memory for the last time</p>
<p>Hold me now, don&#8217;t cry, don&#8217;t say a word<br />
Just hold me now and I will know<br />
Though we&#8217;re apart, we&#8217;ll always be together, forever in love<br />
What do you say when words are not enough?</p>
<p>Time, time will be kind once we&#8217;re apart<br />
And your tears, tears will have no place in your heart<br />
I wish I&#8230; I could say how much I&#8217;ll miss you when you&#8217;re gone<br />
How my love for you will go on and on and</p>
<p>Hold me now, don&#8217;t cry, don&#8217;t say a word<br />
Just hold me now and try to understand that</p>
<p>I hope at last you&#8217;ve found what you&#8217;ve been searchin&#8217; for<br />
And though I won&#8217;t be there anymore I will always love you</p>
<p>(Hold me now, don&#8217;t cry) Don&#8217;t say a word<br />
Just hold me now and I will know<br />
Though we&#8217;re apart, we&#8217;ll always be together, forever in love<br />
What do you say when words are not enough?</p>
<p>What can I say? Now my words are not enough</p>
