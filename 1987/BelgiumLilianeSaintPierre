<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
A new day, a new scandal<br />
We see violence in the news<br />
Children are thrown in the battle<br />
For ideals, for profits</p>
<p>We feel guilty<br />
But sip our wine<br />
You&#8217;re asking yourself constantly<br />
What we are doing</p>
<p>Love chases away discord<br />
Purifies your soul, buries the fighting<br />
Just start with your inner self<br />
And go slowly to the outside world</p>
<p>Take each other&#8217;s hands<br />
Come on, weld those bonds<br />
Do you hear that distant scream?<br />
Nobody asks for that suffering</p>
<p><em>Soldiers of love</em> &#8211; fire off love<br />
No more bullets, all weapons down<br />
<em>Soldiers of love</em> &#8211; fire off love<br />
The weapons down, no more war</p>
<p>I had a dream where I saw<br />
The whole world with a flag<br />
On which you could read in big:<br />
We want peace and no hatred</p>
<p><em>United we stand, together we will fall</em><br />
Lay all weapons down, no more war</p>
<p><em>Soldiers of love</em> &#8211; fire off love<br />
No more bullets, all weapons down<br />
<em>Soldiers of love</em> &#8211; fire off love<br />
The weapons down, no more war</p>
<p><em>Soldiers of love</em></p>
<p><em>Soldiers of love</em> &#8211; fire off love<br />
No more bullets, all weapons down<br />
<em>Soldiers of love</em> &#8211; fire off love<br />
The weapons down, no more war</p>
<p><em>Soldiers of love</em><br />
