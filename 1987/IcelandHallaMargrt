<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The evening has fled all too fast<br />
Outside the window night has come<br />
The candles are burning low<br />
The glasses have become much more than empty</p>
<p>The eyelids are heavy as lead<br />
But no one pretends to understand<br />
That time took it&#8217;s top-hat<br />
As the pianist struck the last note</p>
<p>We disappear slowly and quietly, into the warm night<br />
Slowly and quietly, we walk the street home<br />
Once, once again</p>
<p>Left are chairs, benches, tables<br />
Broken glasses, spoken and unspoken words<br />
Silence at last has it&#8217;s peace<br />
Birds repeat the poem to the new day</p>
<p>We disappear slowly and quietly, into the warm night<br />
Slowly and quietly, we walk the street home</p>
<p>Slowly and quietly, we walk the street home<br />
Slowly and quietly, through the warm night<br />
Once, once again<br />
