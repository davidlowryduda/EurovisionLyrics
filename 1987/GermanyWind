Let the sun into your heart<br />
Send your longing to heaven<br />
Give your dreams a little freedom<br />
Let the sun into your heart</p>
<p>Sometimes you feel sad and you don&#8217;t know why<br />
Thousands of little reasons are making you dumb<br />
You nearly forgot what it&#8217;s like to be a human being<br />
But you are not alone</p>
<p>Let the sun into your heart<br />
Send your longing to heaven<br />
Give your dreams a little freedom<br />
Let the sun into your heart</p>
<p>Sometimes in the nights anger makes you blind<br />
And feelings die like a candlelight in the wind<br />
And you are losing courage, because fear comes over you<br />
But you are not alone</p>
<p>Let the sun into your heart<br />
Send your longing to heaven<br />
Give your dreams a little freedom<br />
Let the sun into your heart</p>
<p>You have to believe in yourself, you don&#8217;t need pity<br />
And you have to love your life, because you only have one<br />
Never stand in the shadow again, go into the light<br />
You are not alone</p>
<p>Let the sun into your heart<br />
Send your longing to heaven<br />
Go into the light with open arms<br />
Let the sun into your heart</p>
<p>Let the sun into your heart<br />
Send your longing to heaven<br />
Give your dreams a little freedom<br />
Let the sun, let the sun<br />
Let the sun into your heart<br />
