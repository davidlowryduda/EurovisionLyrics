<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The world is like a swing forbidden to children<br />
The more one side goes up the more the other side goes down<br />
Above it&#8217;s blue skies, below it&#8217;s tears in your eyes<br />
Not too much, not too little, there must be a middle way</p>
<p>The world is like an unforgiving stupid hour glass<br />
The more one half fills the more the other empties<br />
Below it&#8217;s ready to burst, above nothing more to give<br />
So many things to change, make it half and half</p>
<p>Love is half and half, always make it half and half<br />
Sharing happiness imprisons misfortune<br />
Love is half and half, always make it half and half<br />
All the good which you give imprisons the bad</p>
<p>But somewhere an errant plane crashes in the desert<br />
And the book of life returns to dust<br />
The angel of fortune has struck, the spirit has fled<br />
The message remains, we are going to make it half and half</p>
<p>Love is half and half, always make it half and half<br />
Sharing happiness imprisons misfortune<br />
Love is half and half, always make it half and half<br />
All the good which you give imprisons the bad</p>
<p>Love is half and half, always make it half and half<br />
Sharing happiness imprisons misfortune<br />
Love is half and half, always make it half and half<br />
All the good which you give imprisons the bad<br />
