<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Hold me tight, when you lose courage<br />
I want to be tender, so you don&#8217;t have to freeze<br />
You&#8217;re like a child, that I want to protect<br />
At the beginning, we only have feelings</p>
<p>Also, you&#8217;ve often touched the fire<br />
You&#8217;ve burned yourself on it, you only got lost in it</p>
<p>Our fire burns, slowly and quietly<br />
Because for us, only feelings exist</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll never feel this emptiness again<br />
Only feelings, and nothing more<br />
This love for a time, in loneliness<br />
Are only feelings</p>
<p>Come closer to me, because I want to feel you<br />
And I only give you feelings</p>
<p>As much as you want, only feelings<br />
As much as I have, only feelings<br />
Only feelings<br />
