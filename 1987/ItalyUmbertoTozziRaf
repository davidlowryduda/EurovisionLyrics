We, people from the plains<br />
Excellent drivers in the city<br />
Are always a little scared of the sea<br />
Because of the idea of too much freedom</p>
<p>And although we have the salt in our hair<br />
We have the depth of the sea in our souls<br />
And freezing women in their shawls<br />
Waiting for something which nobody knows</p>
<p>People of the sea, who leave it behind<br />
Going to where they like, they don&#8217;t know where<br />
People dying of nostalgia<br />
But when they go back after one day, they die<br />
Of the desire to go away</p>
<p>(People of the sea) And when we stop on the shore<br />
(People who go) Our look goes to the horizon<br />
(People of the sea) Bringing our thoughts adrift<br />
Because of the idea of too much freedom</p>
<p>People of the sea, who leave it behind<br />
Going to where they like, they don&#8217;t know where<br />
Buccaneer people who are no more<br />
Faraway people carrying in their hearts<br />
This big blue brother</p>
<p>At the other side of the sea, there&#8217;s someone who<br />
There&#8217;s someone who knows nothing about you</p>
<p>People of the sea, who leave it behind<br />
Going to where they like, they don&#8217;t know where<br />
We, prisoners of these cities<br />
We always live for today and for yesterday<br />
Nailed down by reality, and the people of the sea go</p>
<p>(People of the sea, who leave it behind) Who leave it behind<br />
(Going where they like) They don&#8217;t know where<br />
We, prisoners of these big cities<br />
We always live for today and for yesterday<br />
Nailed down by reality, and the people of the sea go<br />
