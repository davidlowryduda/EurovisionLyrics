The white lands are getting darker, singing trees go silent<br />
Children of the streets go into hiding when a storm is rising<br />
Let&#8217;s fear our fears away, nothing could take me away<br />
When love sticks tightly to you and the heart gets warmer</p>
<p>Though a hundred lightnings strike fire, and all of life explodes<br />
Nobody can take love away from me, there&#8217;s always hope<br />
When a hundred suns shine on us<br />
And a ship is ready to depart<br />
I will take our love to a safe place<br />
And we&#8217;ll find a new land</p>
<p>I feel tenderness beside you, a dream of an exhausted land<br />
The last dream gives us shelter from the wind of the night<br />
I see the truth in your hope, you create a flame by whispering<br />
Only love will take us there, it saves us</p>
<p>Though a hundred lightnings strike fire, and all of life explodes<br />
Nobody can take love away from me, there&#8217;s always hope<br />
When a hundred suns shine on us<br />
And a ship is ready to depart<br />
I will take our love to a safe place<br />
And we&#8217;ll find a new land</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a thousand worlds out there, and one of them is ours</p>
<p>Though a hundred lightnings strike fire, and all of life explodes<br />
I will take our love to a safe place<br />
And we&#8217;ll find a new land<br />
I will take our love to a safe place<br />
I will change this land to another white land<br />
