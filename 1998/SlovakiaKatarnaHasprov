Love is fading out, I feel scared<br />
How to survive without our dreams<br />
I want to return, to stop the time<br />
May sadness vanish with the darkness</p>
<p>You go away and hope to find<br />
The world of splendour and fame<br />
You give up and deny our love<br />
So go there, hurry up<br />
Without useless lies and false words</p>
<p>Love, I am walking the valley of tears<br />
Only you can get me out of misery<br />
I long to touch your hands, your lips<br />
Please, come back, do not give up</p>
<p>You are left alone and I know, that they&#8217;re close<br />
But I know, the day of your return is close, I know it will come<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for you, come, away with sadness<br />
I want your love and passion, I want your tenderness<br />
I want everything you have got</p>
<p>A prayer of love, forever<br />
A prayer of passion and tenderness<br />
A prayer of love, hoping in miracles<br />
Inside of us, inside of us</p>
<p>Love, I am walking the valley of tears<br />
Only you can get me out of misery<br />
I long to touch your hands, your lips<br />
Please, come back, do not give up</p>
<p>You are left alone and I know, that they&#8217;re close<br />
But I know, the day of your return is close, I know it will come<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for you, come, away with sadness<br />
I want your love and passion, I want your tenderness<br />
I want everything you have got</p>
<p>A prayer of love, forever<br />
A prayer of passion and tenderness<br />
A prayer of love, hoping in miracles<br />
Inside of us, only us<br />
Inside of us<br />
