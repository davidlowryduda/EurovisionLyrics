<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Stop, dawn, don&#8217;t rise, you fiend<br />
Let the night hide<br />
These eyes which bear pearls<br />
This heart which can&#8217;t love another</p>
<p>The wine leads me to her<br />
And further away from my senses</p>
<p>I have to drink<br />
To get drunk<br />
To live without her<br />
Mother, I can&#8217;t do it</p>
<p>Mother, go and ask her elders<br />
Whether they will give her to me<br />
If they do, call the musicians<br />
If they don&#8217;t, instead of curses<br />
Cry for me</p>
<p>I have to drink<br />
To get drunk<br />
To live alone, without her<br />
Mother, I can&#8217;t do it</p>
<p>I have to drink<br />
To get drunk<br />
To live alone, without her<br />
Mother, I can&#8217;t do it</p>
<p>Dawn, don&#8217;t rise<br />
A drunken dance<br />
Dance with me<br />
