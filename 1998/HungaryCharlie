Look, another picture has been found<br />
I had thought it had been lost for long<br />
You&#8217;re sitting on a terrace, the sun is going down, and it&#8217;s about to rain<br />
In the background there are the sea and the bustling harbour</p>
<p>There was always music in the streets at night<br />
Let&#8217;s go some day and see if it&#8217;s still the same<br />
Ignore what the doctor says, it&#8217;s rubbish<br />
I know you&#8217;ll get better again, I&#8217;m taking care of you</p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll dance like in the past, and people will stare and ask who this girl may be<br />
She&#8217;s so beautiful, we must have fallen asleep and be dreaming<br />
And if the heavenly pilgrim is not so hard after all<br />
Sadness will be over tomorrow</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all right, dear, throughout the years<br />
The world has shown us so many of its different faces<br />
You&#8217;ve always been so brave, braver than giving up hope<br />
I know you&#8217;ll get better again, don&#8217;t be afraid</p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll dance like in the past, and people will stare and ask who this girl may be<br />
She&#8217;s so beautiful, we must have fallen asleep and be dreaming<br />
And if the heavenly pilgrim is not so hard after all<br />
Sadness will be over tomorrow</p>
<p>Sadness will be over tomorrow<br />
Sadness will be over tomorrow<br />
