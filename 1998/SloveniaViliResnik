All there is left for me<br />
Are a few memories and hope<br />
Her picture in front of my eyes<br />
Never fades, it just shines</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wait for her for a thousand years (I&#8217;ll wait for you)<br />
I&#8217;ll be begging on my knees (I&#8217;ll be begging you)<br />
Let someone have mercy<br />
I&#8217;ll scream to the sky I love her</p>
<p>Let the gods hear<br />
That I&#8217;m in pain<br />
Save me<br />
No, I can&#8217;t be without her<br />
My heart is dying</p>
<p>Let someone have mercy<br />
I&#8217;ll scream to the sky I love her</p>
<p>Let the gods hear<br />
That I&#8217;m in pain<br />
Save me<br />
No, I can&#8217;t be without her</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; (Let the gods hear)<br />
Nana naj naj naj naj naj&#8230;<br />
(That I&#8217;m in pain) That I&#8217;m in pain</p>
<p>Save me<br />
No, I can&#8217;t be without her<br />
My heart is dying</p>
<p>My heart is dying<br />
