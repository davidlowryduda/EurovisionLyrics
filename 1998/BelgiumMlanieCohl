Come<br />
If you are tired of your vacuous loves<br />
If you no longer believe in &#8220;never&#8221; or &#8220;forever&#8221;<br />
If you want to slow down and have a little rest<br />
If you believe that we could be happy</p>
<p>Come<br />
If you can&#8217;t be there anymore to compete<br />
I want to warm up from the light of your smile<br />
We will fill the air with the sound of our laughter</em></small><br />
You have to be able to leave someday</p>
<p>Say yes &#8211; you know the earth is beautiful<br />
Say yes &#8211; when we are in unanimity<br />
And then the world needs reconstruction<br />
Say yes &#8211; come for life, come for an hour</p>
<p>See<br />
Something has changed in the sky this morning<br />
It seems the air is purer and that&#8217;s good<br />
You know, the keys to the future are in our hands<br />
So then, when will you join me?</p>
<p>Say yes &#8211; at least we&#8217;ll be together<br />
Say yes &#8211; we&#8217;ll be much stronger together<br />
And then, and then we are similar<br />
Say yes &#8211; I want to learn you by heart</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t stand those bombs<br />
Which all explode around us<br />
You dream of another world<br />
Where money won&#8217;t rule everything</p>
<p>So stop listening to those<br />
Who keep telling you we&#8217;re wrong<br />
You know, it&#8217;s enough to be two<br />
To believe we are already stronger</p>
<p>Come<br />
If you are tired of your vacuous loves<br />
If you no longer believe in &#8220;never&#8221; or &#8220;forever&#8221;<br />
If you want to slow down and have a little rest<br />
If you believe that we could be happy</p>
<p>Say yes &#8211; you know the earth is beautiful<br />
Say yes &#8211; when we are in unanimity<br />
And then the world needs reconstruction<br />
Say yes &#8211; come for life, come for an hour</p>
<p>Say yes<br />
Say yes<br />
