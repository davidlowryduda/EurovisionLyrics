Me, I am still waiting for you, I think it&#8217;s not fair<br />
That only your memory is left<br />
I feel you are, all the time around me<br />
Thought and spirit with which you capture me<br />
You give me courage</p>
<p>I believe you are listening to me, I believe you are don&#8217;t forget<br />
Give me from the sky, a sign that you will stay<br />
If I could only touch your world<br />
I would ask for you back, I believe in us</p>
<p>I may be making a mistake, I don&#8217;t know how to look at<br />
The stars, and there to find you again<br />
You come only in a dream as you have promised<br />
We stay good friends, good friends</p>
<p>I believe you are listening to me, I believe you are don&#8217;t forget<br />
Give me from the sky, a sign that you will stay<br />
If I could only touch your world<br />
I would ask for you back, I believe in us</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel as if you are looking at me<br />
I want you to know, you only give me silence</p>
<p>I believe you are listening to me, I believe you are don&#8217;t forget<br />
Give me from the sky, a sign that you will stay<br />
Me, if I could only touch your world<br />
I would ask for you back<br />
I would ask for you back, I believe in us, ooh&#8230;<br />
