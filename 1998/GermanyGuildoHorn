Guildo loves you<br />
So even if there are tears<br />
He&#8217;ll come over and sing songs for you<br />
Guildo loves you</p>
<p>There was once a time, a time of tenderness<br />
When Caressing and Cuddling and Loving<br />
Were always written with capitals</p>
<p>I like to think back<br />
On those days full of harmony and luck<br />
When I daily wrote in a poetry book:<br />
Yoo hoo hoo – I love you</p>
<p>Guildo loves you<br />
So even if there are tears<br />
He&#8217;ll come over and sing songs for you<br />
Guildo loves you (again and again)</p>
<p>In my little world, where we all stick together<br />
And where tears don&#8217;t lie<br />
Dreams will learn to fly</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I&#8217;d like to be<br />
If the stars weren&#8217;t so far away<br />
And from there I&#8217;d send you the proof of my love:<br />
Nut cookies and raspberry ice cream</p>
<p>Guildo loves you<br />
So even if there are tears<br />
He&#8217;ll come over and sing songs for you<br />
Guildo loves you (again and again)</p>
<p>I like to look back<br />
On those days full of harmony and luck<br />
When I daily wrote in a poetry book:<br />
Yoo hoo hoo – I love you</p>
<p>Guildo loves you<br />
So even if there are tears<br />
He&#8217;ll come over and sing songs for you<br />
Guildo loves you (again and again, again and again)</p>
<p>(Guildo loves us, again and again)<br />
Whoa&#8230; Guildo loves you (again and again)<br />
(Guildo loves us, again and again)<br />
Hey, Guildo loves you<br />
