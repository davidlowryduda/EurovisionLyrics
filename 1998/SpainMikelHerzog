You were the apple of my eye<br />
You were the queen of my heart<br />
You were my world, all my course</p>
<p>A life in front of us<br />
So many dreams to share<br />
And in a moment you forgot to live</p>
<p>What am I going to do without you<br />
If you&#8217;re no longer here?<br />
How can I give you love?<br />
So many kisses I haven&#8217;t given to you</p>
<p>What am I going to do without you<br />
If you&#8217;re no longer here?<br />
What can I tell my heart<br />
That doesn&#8217;t stop repeating?<br />
What will I do without you?</p>
<p>Now you have to go<br />
I don&#8217;t want to separate from you<br />
If I don&#8217;t have you why do I want to live?</p>
<p>What am I going to do without you<br />
If you&#8217;re no longer here?<br />
How can I give you love?<br />
So many kisses I haven&#8217;t given to you</p>
<p>What am I going to do without you<br />
If you&#8217;re no longer here?<br />
What can I tell my heart<br />
That doesn&#8217;t stop repeating?<br />
What am I going to do without you?</p>
<p>What am I going to do without you<br />
If you&#8217;re no longer here?<br />
How can I give you love?<br />
So many kisses I haven&#8217;t given to you</p>
<p>What am I going to do without you<br />
If you&#8217;re no longer here?<br />
What can I tell my heart<br />
That is tired of repeating?<br />
What am I going to do without you?<br />
