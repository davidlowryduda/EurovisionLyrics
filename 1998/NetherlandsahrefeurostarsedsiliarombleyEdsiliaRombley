The Netherlands were cool and chilly, and especially the weather<br />
The wind, it never fell, my love life all the more<br />
What I read in your eyes lightened my fire<br />
It&#8217;s quite often underrated, the force of nature</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are moving when you&#8217;re in front of me<br />
For me it&#8217;s proven that fate exists<br />
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me<br />
I never wanted to believe, but there&#8217;s more<br />
Between heaven and earth</p>
<p>Black skies are breaking open on the horizon<br />
Now I&#8217;ll warm myself by the rays of the sun (Rays of the sun)<br />
I&#8217;ve tried love, it was never what it seemed<br />
But I saw the future when I looked into your eyes</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are moving when you&#8217;re in front of me<br />
For me it&#8217;s proven that fate exists<br />
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me<br />
I never wanted to believe, but there&#8217;s more</p>
<p>(Heaven and earth are moving) When you&#8217;re in front of me<br />
(For me it&#8217;s proven) Oh, that fate exists<br />
Heaven and earth are opening when you touch me<br />
I never wanted to believe, but there&#8217;s more</p>
<p>(Heaven and earth) Oh hayah&#8230; huah&#8230;<br />
(Heaven and earth) Ahaha, ahaha, ahahahahuah..<br />
(Heaven and earth) Ah ah ah, ah&#8230; huah ah&#8230;<br />
(Heaven and earth) Ah&#8230;</p>
<p>(Heaven and earth are moving) When you&#8217;re in front of me<br />
(Het is voor mij bewezen) Oh, that fate exists<br />
(Heaven and earth are opening) Heaven and earth<br />
(When you touch me) Hey&#8230;</p>
<p>I never wanted to believe, but there&#8217;s more, oho&#8230;<br />
Between heaven and earth<br />
