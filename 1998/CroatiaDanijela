Another day has passed by<br />
Once more, the moon has come<br />
Silently, like a dear guest<br />
To abridge my mornings</p>
<p>For the sorrow leads me through the years<br />
Steals the dream, till a new day dawns</p>
<p>May the dawn never rise<br />
May I disappear, may I cease to exist<br />
May I not wake up without you</p>
<p>May the dawn never rise<br />
May I disappear, may I cease to exist<br />
May I not wake up without you</p>
