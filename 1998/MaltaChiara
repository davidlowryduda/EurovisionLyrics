<p>Such a lovely night, when the stars are shining bright<br />
And you&#8217;re near, we&#8217;re all alone, &#8217;cause I long for you so much<br />
I never felt this way, not before<br />
You turn on my mind more and more</p>
<p>I think that I&#8217;m in love and you mean so much to me<br />
I think I love you so, I&#8217;ll never let you go<br />
This must be love</p>
<p>Up there we seem to flow, I&#8217;m certain and now I know<br />
For me, yes, you&#8217;re just the one<br />
The one that I love</p>
<p>Such a lovely sight, when the colours shine so bright<br />
And you&#8217;re near, we&#8217;re all alone, and I feel so warm inside<br />
I never felt this way all my life<br />
You came like spring sunshine, gave me life</p>
<p>I think that I&#8217;m in love and you mean so much to me<br />
I think I love you so, I&#8217;ll never let you go<br />
This must be love</p>
<p>Up there we seem to flow, I&#8217;m certain and now I know<br />
For me, yes, you&#8217;re just the one<br />
The one that I love</p>
<p>For me, yes, you&#8217;re just the one<br />
The one that I love</p>
