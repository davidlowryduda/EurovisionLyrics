Outside a new day is dawning<br />
Your breath awakens me<br />
I&#8217;m waiting impatiently for the sound of your voice<br />
But all I hear is rain</p>
<p>I run away, as far as I&#8217;m concerned<br />
But I have the intuition, that</p>
<p>I know and you know too<br />
We&#8217;ve got the best that we can get<br />
When you want to suppress anger<br />
It&#8217;s so easy</p>
<p>Silently I search for your warm lips<br />
Secretly I hold my tears<br />
The wind swept up those most tender moments<br />
Carrying them further and further away</p>
<p>I run away, I&#8217;ll lose you<br />
But I have the intuition, that</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; I know and you know too<br />
We&#8217;ve got the best that we can get<br />
When you want to suppress anger<br />
It&#8217;s easy, embrace me<br />
Yoohoo&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy<br />
Whoa&#8230; yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; I know and you know too<br />
We&#8217;ve got the best that we can get<br />
When you want to suppress anger<br />
It&#8217;s easy, embrace me</p>
<p>(Got the best, got the best, yeah)<br />
And you know it too<br />
(Got the best, got the best, yeah)<br />
That we can get</p>
<p>(Got the best, got the best, yeah)<br />
It&#8217;s easy, embrace me<br />
