I read your eyes like an open book<br />
Living together we read each other word by word (To be near you)<br />
It&#8217;s more than just the two of us can see (Because we have more)<br />
What we have is so much more</p>
<p>&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;, you said<br />
And you came, and you saw, and you won my life<br />
&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;, you said<br />
What the others do now, means nothing<br />
&#8220;Forever warm days&#8221;, you said</p>
<p>And reached out your hands and said: &#8220;It feels quite good&#8221;<br />
Oh&#8230; (&#8220;Always summer&#8221;, you said)</p>
<p>If only I could find the words to tell what you mean to me<br />
We live, play together, as we take the same road (To love you)<br />
Year by year, and day by day (Together with you)<br />
Our happiness grows with every heartbeat</p>
<p>&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;, you said<br />
And you came, and you saw, and you won my life<br />
&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;, you said<br />
What the others do now, means nothing<br />
&#8220;Forever warm days&#8221;, you said</p>
<p>And reached out your hands and said: &#8220;It feels quite good&#8221;<br />
Oh&#8230; &#8220;always summer&#8221;, you said</p>
<p>My loneliness vanished, and love won<br />
So come and let us live, you said: &#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;</p>
<p>(&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;, you said)<br />
And you came, and you saw, and you won my life<br />
&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;, you said (&#8220;Always eternal summer&#8221;)<br />
What the others do now, means nothing<br />
&#8220;Forever warm days&#8221;, you said</p>
<p>And reached out your hands and said: &#8220;It feels quite good&#8221;<br />
Oh&#8230; &#8220;always summer&#8221;, you said<br />
(Ooh&#8230;) &#8220;Always summer&#8221;, you said<br />
