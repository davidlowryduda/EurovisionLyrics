<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
A secret illusion builds your picture<br />
With the words and the thoughts which have your colour<br />
In the night, in the night</p>
<p>The moon makes magic to the sky<br />
And what is left begins a secret dance in the mind<br />
In the night, in the night</p>
<p>Tonight, in vain I am going to walk<br />
In the roads of your imagination<br />
Even if I wake up from your touch<br />
In the darkness of your soul I&#8217;m always going to die</p>
<p>A secret illusion saves your shadow<br />
My soul is ruled by this<br />
In the night, in the night</p>
<p>Tonight, in vain I am going to walk<br />
In the roads of your imagination<br />
Even if I wake up from your touch<br />
In the darkness of your soul I&#8217;m always going to die</p>
<p>Even if I wake up from your touch<br />
In the darkness of your soul I&#8217;m always going to die</p>
<p>In vain<br />
