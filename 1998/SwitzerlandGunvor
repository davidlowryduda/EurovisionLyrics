He serves cocktails every night<br />
He wins all women over using his charm<br />
You too let him bedazzle you<br />
After a few hours, you were already in his arms</p>
<p>Let him go at last, he often walked out on you<br />
It&#8217;s only appearance, let him be at last<br />
How often he cheated you, you thought he would change<br />
But you lied to yourself, say, doesn&#8217;t it hurt?</p>
<p>Saturday and you&#8217;re looking forward for the night to come<br />
You still have loads to do before you finish work<br />
But you keep thinking about it<br />
You can&#8217;t get him out of your mind, you leave work, even abandon your job</p>
<p>Let him go at last, he often walked out on you<br />
It&#8217;s only appearance, let him be at last<br />
How often he cheated you, you thought he would change<br />
But you lied to yourself, say, doesn&#8217;t it hurt?</p>
<p>Let him go at last, he often walked out on you<br />
It as only appearance, let him be at last<br />
How often he cheated you, you thought he would change<br />
But you lied to yourself, say, doesn&#8217;t it hurt?</p>
<p>Say, doesn&#8217;t it hurt?<br />
It hurts so much<br />
