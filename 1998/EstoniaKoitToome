We&#8217;ve given an oath, signed a contract<br />
Left the quay<br />
Our luggage is brought on board and the sails are set<br />
And the bow is turned towards dawn</p>
<p>Look, in the stern goes into the horizon<br />
Even the last spire of our home tower<br />
So our childhood is left behind on the beach<br />
And our journey starts</p>
<p>My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new<br />
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun<br />
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path<br />
Belong only to each other</p>
<p>When space lies before us<br />
No matter if it&#8217;s charged by the storm<br />
Our dreams and risks are mutual<br />
In a whirl of waves</p>
<p>My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new<br />
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun<br />
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path<br />
Belong only to each other</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got the sheet and I have the rudder in my hand<br />
Our goal binds us together<br />
We&#8217;ve got the same boat in the midst of these winds<br />
Where we can hold only each other</p>
<p>My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new<br />
My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new<br />
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun<br />
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path<br />
Belong only to each other</p>
<p>My darling can you understand everything ahead of us is new<br />
Now in the rain, in the wind, in a blaze of the sun<br />
Our bodies, souls and minds on this path<br />
Belong only to each other<br />
