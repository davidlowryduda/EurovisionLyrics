All the lands of the world<br />
Have the soul of Portugal<br />
Wherever you are, wherever you go<br />
The longing is already there</p>
<p>If I could embrace you<br />
And talk to you after<br />
I&#8217;d have so much to tell you<br />
My brother and my friend</p>
<p>Wandering, wandering<br />
We cover the distance by walking<br />
Motherland and fatherland<br />
That distance makes you cry</p>
<p>Sailing, sailing<br />
Over land and over sea<br />
You need to believe<br />
If I could embrace you</p>
<p>In every part of the world<br />
There is a Portuguese<br />
Longing for someone who left someone<br />
On the other side of the sea</p>
<p>If I could embrace you<br />
And talk to you after<br />
I&#8217;d have so much to tell you<br />
My brother and my friend</p>
<p>Wandering, wandering<br />
We cover the distance by walking<br />
Motherland and fatherland<br />
That distance makes you cry</p>
<p>Sailing, sailing<br />
Over land and over sea<br />
You need to believe<br />
If I could embrace you</p>
<p>Wandering, wandering<br />
We cover the distance by walking<br />
Motherland and fatherland<br />
That distance makes you cry</p>
<p>Sailing, sailing<br />
Over land and over sea<br />
You need to believe<br />
If I could embrace you<br />
