My loneliness knocked on my silent door again<br />
When I had forgotten the path to darkness<br />
We have lost the yesterdays, longing for tomorrows<br />
Cry, my heart cry, &#8217;cause this is the final storm</p>
<p>It will be a waste for us, for our love<br />
Don&#8217;t draw us to sorrow in one breath<br />
If my captivity to you is the only thing that you have left me<br />
Cry my heart, there is a lot of time for the light</p>
<p>Why should our hands<br />
Part our loving eyes?<br />
Didn&#8217;t our hearts stop beating, when we were apart?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t forget even if years pass by<br />
Even if our hair begins to turn grey<br />
No one can make us forget each other</p>
