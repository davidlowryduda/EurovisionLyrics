You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
You don&#8217;t even know where to go<br />
You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
You don&#8217;t even know where to go</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
When you&#8217;re stuck, your eyes are closed<br />
Nobody can decide the course of your life<br />
Only you can draw it</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not the first one<br />
Hope will encourage you<br />
If you think, you revive<br />
If you weaken, you give up</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
You don&#8217;t even know where to go<br />
You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
No, no</p>
<p>In your manners, you&#8217;re well up<br />
But your heart speaks<br />
You drool, you work hard, you feel bad</p>
<p>To see very clear<br />
You could find the real road, the faith, the strength<br />
Leading to the truth</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
You don&#8217;t even know where to go<br />
You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go<br />
You don&#8217;t even know where to go</p>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t have, oh, somewhere to go<br />
(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)</p>
<p>Only you can change everything<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
Oh no</p>
<p>(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)<br />
(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)<br />
Oh la&#8230;</p>
<p>(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)<br />
Oh lala&#8230;<br />
(Not even somewhere to go, not even somewhere to go)<br />
Oh la&#8230;</p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
No, you don&#8217;t have<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
Oh&#8230; somewhere to go</p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
Oh&#8230; where to go<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
Oh no</p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
Oh la&#8230; where to go</p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
Oh&#8230; where to go<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
Oh la&#8230;</p>
<p>(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
La la&#8230;<br />
(You don&#8217;t have somewhere to go)<br />
(You don&#8217;t even know where to go)<br />
