<p>I never thought that it would end<br />
You were the one â€“ my love, my friend<br />
You were my every dream come true<br />
Always, you said, was me and you</p>
<p>So how can you say it&#8217;s over now?<br />
How can you wave it all goodbye?<br />
Always, you said, this love would be<br />
Always, you said, was you and me</p>
<p>Is always over now?<br />
Does it never last that long?<br />
Were the feelings that I had<br />
Ever right, or was it wrong?</p>
<p>To think that love should last<br />
Was mistaken on my part<br />
But you promised me the earth<br />
(You promised me&#8230;) And you only broke my heart</p>
<p>You touched my soul<br />
You touched my life<br />
You always would, you said<br />
But now, you are taking always away</p>
<p>Is always over now?<br />
Does it never last that long?<br />
Were the feelings that I had<br />
Ever right, or was it wrong?</p>
<p>To think that love should last<br />
Was mistaken on my part<br />
But you promised me the earth<br />
(You promised me&#8230;) And you only broke my heart</p>
<p>Is always over now?<br />
Does it never last that long?<br />
Were the feelings that I had<br />
Ever right, or was it wrong?</p>
<p>To think that love should last<br />
Was mistaken on my part<br />
But you promised me the earth<br />
(You promised me&#8230;) And you only broke my heart<br />
(You promised me&#8230;)</p>
