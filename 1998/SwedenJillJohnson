Here, in the still dawn<br />
I can feel everything breathe again<br />
The heavy clouds drifted away with the winds<br />
No tears from the sky turns into rain</p>
<p>(We hear the words from a song) Which is still in our hearts<br />
(We in calm after the storm)</p>
<p>An angel passed, to heaven so free<br />
But she left her smile on our Earth<br />
Like a sun which makes us warm, like a heaven&#8217;s starlight<br />
So that we can observe life&#8217;s process with a belief<br />
Love is</p>
<p>Here, and where the night is approaching<br />
We&#8217;re safe in each other&#8217;s breaths<br />
(A wind, which nestles against)<br />
Carries a smell of wild rose</p>
<p>An angel passed to heaven so free<br />
But she left her smile on our Earth<br />
Like a sun which makes us warm, like a heaven&#8217;s starlight<br />
So that we can observe life&#8217;s process with a belief<br />
Love is</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>An angel passed to heaven so free<br />
But she left her smile on our Earth<br />
Like a sun which makes us warm, like a heaven&#8217;s starlight<br />
So that we can observe life&#8217;s process with a belief<br />
That love is<br />
