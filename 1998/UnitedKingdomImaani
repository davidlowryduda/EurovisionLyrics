<p>I see your picture in a frame<br />
I see a face without a name<br />
Riding alone on an empty train<br />
Where are you?</p>
<p>I live in a house of broken hearts<br />
Leaves are falling in the park<br />
Every day is a question mark<br />
Where are you?</p>
<p>I would drive through the rain (To find you)<br />
Walk a desert plain (Behind you)<br />
You could unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Through the storm I call your name (To guide you)<br />
Love could be the flame (Beside you)<br />
If you unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Lying in my room at night<br />
Silhouettes are dressed in white<br />
Waiting for the morning light<br />
Where are you?</p>
<p>Each day you will live and learn<br />
As the wheels of heaven turn<br />
For you my candle burns<br />
Where are you?</p>
<p>I would drive through the rain (To find you)<br />
Walk a desert plain (Behind you)<br />
You could unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Through the storm I call your name (To guide you)<br />
Love could be the flame (Beside you)<br />
If you unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>(So near) so near, (so far) so far<br />
Out there I can almost touch you<br />
You&#8217;re here in my mind all the time<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>(I would drive through the rain) To find you<br />
(Walk a desert plain behind you)<br />
You could unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Through the storm (I call your name to guide you)<br />
Love could be the flame (Beside you)<br />
If you unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you? Where are you now?</p>
<p>(I would drive through the rain to find you)<br />
(Walk a desert plain behind you)<br />
If you unlock these chains (I&#8217;m tied to)<br />
Where are you now?</p>
<p>Through the storm (I call your name to guide you)<br />
Love could be the flame (Beside you)<br />
(If you unlock these chains)</p>
