I&#8217;m that one who chases after you every night<br />
I&#8217;m that one who doesn&#8217;t live anymore because he loves you<br />
The one who waits for you, the one who dreams of you<br />
The one who wants to be the owner of your love, of your love</p>
<p>I&#8217;m that one who gives his life to have you<br />
I&#8217;m that one who&#8217;s far away and doesn&#8217;t forget you<br />
The one who waits for you, the one who dreams of you<br />
That one who every night prays for your love</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m here, here, to love you<br />
I&#8217;m here, here, to adore you<br />
I&#8217;m here, here to tell you<br />
That nobody loved you like I did</p>
<p>I&#8217;m that one who gives his life to have you<br />
I&#8217;m that one who being far away doesn&#8217;t forget you<br />
The one who waits for you, the one who dreams of you<br />
That one who every night prays for your love</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m here, here, to love you<br />
I&#8217;m here, here, to adore you<br />
I&#8217;m here, here to tell you<br />
Love, love, love, love<br />
