A bit of pepper, a bit of salt<br />
A bit of love, a bit of honey<br />
When this all will be mixed together<br />
You&#8217;ll finally be able to say that it happened</p>
<p>He always passed me right under my nose<br />
I didn&#8217;t exist for him<br />
He couldn&#8217;t know that my big love<br />
Flourished not far from him</p>
<p>To the local sorceress<br />
I could finally tell about him<br />
She looked at me for a long, long time<br />
And this is what she told me</p>
<p>&#8220;A bit of pepper, a bit of salt&#8221;<br />
&#8220;A bit of love, a bit of honey&#8221;<br />
&#8220;When this all will be mixed together&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;ll finally be able to say that it happened&#8221;</p>
<p>I followed with no further explanation<br />
The advice she gave me<br />
To win the love of this beautiful boy<br />
I wanted to try everything</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve bought a brandy<br />
At one hundred and twenty-one degrees<br />
And strongly thinking about him<br />
I&#8217;ve added bravely</p>
<p>A bit of pepper, a bit of salt<br />
A bit of love, a bit of honey<br />
When that all was mixed together<br />
What had to happen, happened</p>
<p>Tom topo tom tom tom to tom&#8230;<br />
Tom topo tom tom tom to tom&#8230;</p>
<p>Upon a beautiful day he came to me<br />
My mother invited him<br />
I gave him my herb tea to drink<br />
And after that, everything changed</p>
<p>I love him, he loves me, we love each other<br />
As in a fairy tale<br />
To hold a boy dear<br />
It&#8217;s enough to give him</p>
<p>A bit of pepper, a bit of salt<br />
A bit of love, a bit of honey</p>
<p>A bit of pepper, a bit of salt<br />
