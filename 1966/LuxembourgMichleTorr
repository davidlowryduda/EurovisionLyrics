The wind could be shaking the branches<br />
On the street the shutters are shut<br />
On a white table-cloth a few roses are leaning<br />
On a cutlery set for two</p>
<p>The melody that you prefer<br />
Put onto the piano board<br />
Everything is ready, I hope, I have nothing more to do<br />
But to open the door, &#8217;cause I hear your steps<br />
But there you are, but don&#8217;t act as if you&#8217;re surprised</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight<br />
I was so sure that you would come<br />
Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight<br />
I was right to expect you</p>
<p>We hurt each other a lot<br />
We broke up for a few words<br />
It&#8217;s the old story, I know very well that you love me<br />
That&#8217;s why I was looking forward to your steps<br />
And here I am, right in front of you, spreading out my arms</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight<br />
I was so sure that you would come<br />
Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight<br />
I was right to expect you</p>
<p>Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight<br />
To keep you for evermore<br />
Yes, I knew, and I waited for you, I waited for you tonight<br />
I waited for you tonight<br />
