<p>Fernando, Fernando<br />
Guitarist from Santiago<br />
Plays the whole evening solo<br />
And then still drives to San Antonio</p>
<p>Filippo, Filippo<br />
Is totally different from Fernando<br />
Really, he doesn&#8217;t get into his car<br />
And then still drives to San Antonio</p>
<p>But Fernando is longing so much for her<br />
Even though he&#8217;s tired, he takes his guitar<br />
Gives his songs and his love as a present to her<br />
In San Antonio</p>

<p>Fernando, Fernando<br />
Guitarist from Santiago<br />
Plays the whole evening solo<br />
And then still drives to San Antonio</p>
<p>But once the dice were loaded against him<br />
One night he couldn&#8217;t find his girl anymore<br />
She went to Filippo in the evening<br />
Disappeared alone from San Antonio</p>
<p>Filippo, Filippo<br />
Now says to Fernando in the evening:<br />
&#8220;Just wait a while, because she&#8217;ll be here soon&#8221;<br />
&#8220;She&#8217;s coming for me from San Antonio&#8221;</p>
