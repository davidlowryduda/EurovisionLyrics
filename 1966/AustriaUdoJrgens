Thank you, thank you, thank you<br />
For the hours darling, darling, darling<br />
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling<br />
Don&#8217;t be sad, as I have to leave you</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye<br />
Your tears are painful, so painful, so painful<br />
Our dream flies away, away, thank you, darling<br />
Don&#8217;t cry, also that serves a useful purpose</p>
<p>Look ahead, not back<br />
You can&#8217;t force luck<br />
Because no sea is as wild as love<br />
Only love can be like that<br />
Be like that, be like that</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you<br />
For the hours, darling, darling, darling<br />
Our love was beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling</p>
<p>So beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling<br />
So beautiful, so beautiful, thank you, darling<br />
Thank you<br />
