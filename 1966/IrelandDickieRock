<p>My love, I need your touch<br />
I need your love so very much<br />
Since you went away<br />
I cried for you each night and day</p>
<p>The day you went away<br />
I said I didn&#8217;t mind<br />
Now I know that you have left<br />
A broken heart behind</p>
<p>Please, come back to stay<br />
And promise me you&#8217;ll never stray<br />
I promise I&#8217;ll be true<br />
And that I&#8217;ll never make you blue</p>
<p>For no one else can take your place<br />
Your smile, your lips, your eyes, your face<br />
Please, darling, oh please<br />
Come back to me to stay</p>
<p>Please, come back to stay<br />
And promise me you&#8217;ll never stray<br />
I promise that I&#8217;ll be true<br />
And that I&#8217;ll never make you blue</p>
<p>For no one else can take your place<br />
Your smile, your lips, your eyes, your face<br />
Please, darling, oh please<br />
Come back to me to stay</p>
<p>Oh darling, please come back to stay</p>
