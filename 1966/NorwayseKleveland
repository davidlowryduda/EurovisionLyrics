I know an old man, someone who has lived for a long time<br />
I know an old man, someone who has lived for a long time<br />
He&#8217;s so kind asking me what has happened to me<br />
And if the sun had burnt me</p>
<p>I talk and seek comfort, he rocks in his chair<br />
He says with a broken voice: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new under the sun&#8221;</p>
<p>But what does it matter if things happened before me?<br />
But what does it matter if things happened before me?<br />
No, what makes me hurt so much with all that he knew<br />
That his eyes were sad</p>
<p>What can expect myself in that rocking chair?<br />
When he&#8217;s so sad there now, there&#8217;s nothing new under the sun<br />
