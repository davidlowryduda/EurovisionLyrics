<p>A man without love is only half a man<br />
And half a man is nothing<br />
A man without love cannot begin to dream<br />
For all his dreams lead nowhere</p>
<p>That was me, the man I used to be<br />
A lonely cloud who&#8217;d never found his destiny<br />
Then you came, you touched my heart and told the pain to go<br />
And now I know</p>
<p>A man who is loved has everything in life<br />
And all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds<br />
That he knows never sang<br />
For a man without love</p>
<p>That was me<br />
The man I used to be<br />
A lonely cloud who&#8217;d never found his destiny</p>
<p>Then you came<br />
You touched my heart and told the pain to go<br />
And now I know</p>
<p>A man who is loved has everything in life<br />
And all his life is roses and rainbows and songbirds<br />
That he knows never sang<br />
For a man without love</p>
