Once upon a time there was<br />
A pig breeder, a really cool man<br />
And a princess, a proud maiden she was<br />
One day they met and he stepped up to her and said:</p>
<p>Gosh almighty, you seem to be a cool lady<br />
Look at that dress, really happening, is there a fancy dress party or something?<br />
Get lost, you&#8217;re such a peasant</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a princess, rather prudish<br />
My name is Cunigunda, the king&#8217;s sweetheart<br />
Hey, take it easy, chill out<br />
Listen to me drumming on my saucepan</p>
<p>Dig dig pop&#8230;</p>
<p>Oops, such a groovy tune you drummed just there<br />
If you teach me how to drum you can kiss me<br />
Every girl has a mouth, what about a coin instead?</p>
<p>I drink from the brook, I eat soil<br />
If you have a coin in your pocket you&#8217;re better off<br />
You&#8217;re such a cheeky devil, you won&#8217;t get any gold<br />
But I want to drum on your saucepan</p>
<p>Dig dig pop&#8230;</p>
<p>Bang, gosh, the girl&#8217;s in a hurry<br />
What&#8217;s so special about it? There are lots of saucepans<br />
That saucepan sounds groovy, a cool sound, a nice ring to it</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make a deal, take it or leave it<br />
I&#8217;ll be a hip pig breeder, and you can be the king&#8217;s sweetheart<br />
Me as a princess? Sure, I&#8217;m hip<br />
Then take my drum, take my saucepan</p>
<p>He, as a princess, a hip man wearing clip-on ties<br />
Was thrown out of the castle by the guards<br />
She, as a pig breeder, a prudish chick wearing a tie<br />
Drove everybody mad, playing her saucepan</p>
<p>Trading your saucepan turned out to be a really bad idea<br />
