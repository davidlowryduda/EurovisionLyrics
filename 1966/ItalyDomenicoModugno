In the sky the clouds pass by<br />
They&#8217;re going towards the sea<br />
Looking like white handkerchiefs<br />
That greet our love</p>
<p>My God, I love you so much, it&#8217;s not possible<br />
To have so much happiness between your arms<br />
Kissing your lips that smell like the wind<br />
We&#8217;re two lovers, like nobody in the world</p>
<p>My God, I love you so much, I feel like crying<br />
In my whole life, I&#8217;ve never felt</p>
<p>Such a valuable happiness, such a true happiness<br />
Who can stop the river that flows towards the sea?<br />
The swallows in the sky that go towards the sun?<br />
Who can change my love, my love for you?</p>
<p>My God, I love you so much</p>
<p>Such a valuable happiness, such a true happiness<br />
Who can stop the river that flows towards the sea?<br />
The swallows in the sky that go towards the sun?<br />
Who can change my love, my love for you?</p>
<p>My God, I love you so much<br />
My God, I love you so much<br />
