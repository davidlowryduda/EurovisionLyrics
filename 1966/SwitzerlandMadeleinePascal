Don&#8217;t you see that nowadays I&#8217;m not a child anymore?<br />
Don&#8217;t you see that the years have passed?<br />
Since then, my heart has also grown<br />
And I love you more than a friend</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you see &#8211; each time you take my arm<br />
Don&#8217;t you see that I lean on you?<br />
When you embrace me, I&#8217;m afraid one would say<br />
That we are, you and me, brother and sister</p>
<p>People say that love is blind<br />
But I think it&#8217;s deaf like you<br />
It&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m all alone when I tell you that</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you see that I&#8217;m not a child anymore nowadays?<br />
Don&#8217;t you see that the years have passed?<br />
Deep in me, love has grown too<br />
And I love you much more than a friend</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you see &#8211; now that I have taken your arm<br />
Don&#8217;t you see that you lean on me?<br />
The first step, I had to take it before you<br />
And you love me since that day<br />
And we love each other since that day<br />
