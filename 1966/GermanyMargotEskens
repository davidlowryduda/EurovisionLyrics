<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Sometimes you still read the old letters he wrote you<br />
In which every line read: &#8220;I love you&#8221;<br />
You close your eyes and dream of him<br />
And of the lost happiness</p>
<p>Yet the hands of time only turn<br />
Forwards, forwards and never backwards</p>
<p>You still have a lot of nice pictures from that time<br />
You feel sorrow about those wonderful years<br />
You close your eyes, dream of him<br />
And of the lost happiness</p>
<p>Yet the hands of time only turn<br />
Forwards, forwards and never backwards</p>
<p>You feel lonely and dream of yesterday<br />
But you&#8217;re living today<br />
Someone will come along to free you from your dreams<br />
You&#8217;ll close your eyes<br />
And then a new happiness will begin for you</p>
<p>Then the hands of time only turn<br />
Forwards, forwards and never backwards</p>
<p>The hands of time only turn<br />
Forwards, forwards and never backwards<br />
