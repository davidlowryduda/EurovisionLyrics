Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live<br />
Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real luck that we&#8217;ve got to know each other<br />
Since the last holidays that you came to us<br />
Crossing the Atlantic Ocean, you classically had<br />
Romantic ideas about our people</p>
<p>Because for a long time already, in the eyes of foreigners<br />
Our old continent hasn&#8217;t changed much<br />
It&#8217;s with the eternal manners<br />
That in Europe boys pay court to girls</p>
<p>The fact remains that we love each other<br />
And that we&#8217;re even able<br />
To get married without problem<br />
The way it is done here</p>
<p>You wanted to take me there<br />
In your city of birth<br />
Where everything is big, too big, believe me<br />
Where the walls never end</p>
<p>I really want to follow you, but I&#8217;ve read in books<br />
That it&#8217;s still better to live here</p>
<p>Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live<br />
Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live</p>
<p>I prefer to big cities<br />
The gentleness of a small village<br />
In the public square during the summer evenings<br />
We can have fun and dance</p>
<p>All those differences in both our lives<br />
Have no importance for being happy here<br />
In the street where I live, everybody invites you<br />
To become very quickly as a child of our own</p>
<p>Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live<br />
Where we live, where we live, where we live, where we live<br />
