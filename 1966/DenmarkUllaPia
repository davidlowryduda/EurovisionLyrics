When a girl&#8217;s going home from her first dance<br />
It happens that her friend<br />
Goes just a bit too far, yes, that happens so often<br />
But she answers back:</p>
<p>Stop, yes stop<br />
Yes stop, while the going is good<br />
For I can feel, that you&#8217;ll forget<br />
That I should be home by two o&#8217;clock</p>
<p>What if, yes what if<br />
Yes what if the dreams would burst<br />
For I think you can see<br />
Time stops completely, when you hold so tight</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just wander on<br />
Aimlessly<br />
Enjoy the tranquillity of the starry sky<br />
It was made for us</p>
<p>Come, yes come<br />
Yes come, perhaps I&#8217;ll say yes<br />
When the time has come for the puzzle of love<br />
It will be without a &#8216;stop&#8217;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just wander on<br />
Aimlessly<br />
Enjoy the tranquillity of the starry sky<br />
It was made for us</p>
<p>Come, yes come<br />
Yes come, perhaps I&#8217;ll say yes<br />
When the time has come for the puzzle of love<br />
It will be without a &#8216;stop&#8217;<br />
