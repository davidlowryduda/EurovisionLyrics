Before goodbye, adventure<br />
Before goodbye, madness<br />
Before goodbye, tenderness<br />
Moonlight promises and the song of the sea, because&#8230;</p>
<p>Before goodbye (Your poetry, your laments)<br />
Improvise (Heard throughout the whole street)<br />
Before goodbye (On the other corner of the wind)<br />
In my smile (On the other side of the moon)</p>
<p>Before goodbye (Your dreams were mine)<br />
Paradise (You were by my side)<br />
We read the signs (Before saying goodbye)<br />
And we even reached immortality</p>
<p>And the night is a river where the sun sets<br />
My body is the ship on the tide of your voice<br />
Challenging sounds, vibrating for us<br />
And the light of the dawn was magical</p>
<p>Before goodbye (You returned my poets)<br />
Outrage (In your eyes I saw grudge)<br />
Before goodbye (There were secret words)<br />
Suspicion (On the reverse of love)</p>
<p>Before goodbye (Wickedly you have hidden)<br />
Imperfect (A book by Saramago)<br />
Dividing in two (And a record by Abrunhosa)<br />
To later remember, but&#8230;</p>
<p>The blue of the sky, no longer is true<br />
The magic of the city vanished in ashes<br />
The shadow of anxiety emerged in my eyes<br />
And pain hushed all music</p>
<p>The blue of the sky, no longer is true<br />
The magic of the city vanished in ashes<br />
The shadow of anxiety emerged in my eyes<br />
And pain hushed all music</p>
<p>After the goodbye, deep sadness<br />
</div>
