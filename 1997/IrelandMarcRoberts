<p>I saw you at an airport, ticket in your hand<br />
I got a feeling in my heart I didn&#8217;t understand<br />
Something in the way you were, something foreign in your eyes<br />
Made me wish that I could share one moment of your life</p>
<p>Mysterious woman, I wonder, did you see<br />
The kind of spell you put on me?<br />
Mysterious woman, I wish I could find the key<br />
To the kind of spell you put on me</p>
<p>The room was full of faces but you stood out from the crowd<br />
People going places far away beyond the clouds<br />
Were you from the streets of Paris, or the coast of Italy?<br />
Or were you from as far away as the gulf of Araby?</p>
<p>Mysterious woman, I wonder, did you see<br />
The kind of spell you put on me?<br />
Mysterious woman, I wish I could find the key<br />
To the kind of spell you put on me</p>
<p>Did I imagine you smiled<br />
Or were my thoughts going wild?</p>
<p>Suddenly you were going, the speaker called your plane<br />
There was no way of knowing if I&#8217;d ever see you again<br />
But this brief, so brief encounter will always stay with me<br />
I will always treasure the bittersweet memory</p>
<p>Mysterious woman, I wonder, did you see<br />
The kind of spell you put on me?<br />
Mysterious woman, it&#8217;ll always be a mystery<br />
The kind of spell you put on me</p>
