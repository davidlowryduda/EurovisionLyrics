Somewhere at the town&#8217;s end, an old house sleeps<br />
Behind the ninth window, a girl is awake<br />
The golden moon is counting her tears<br />
The night hides them, just like they&#8217;re stars</p>
<p>By the empty table, every night she waits<br />
Her pure spirit&#8217;s calling out for help:<br />
&#8220;Good fairies, where are those lips&#8221;<br />
&#8220;That are magic when lovers kiss?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wake up, good prince<br />
I would like to give you all<br />
My dreams and my youth<br />
Break the spell of the fairy tale</p>
<p>Wake up, good prince<br />
I would like to give you all<br />
My dreams and my youth<br />
Break the spell of the fairy tale</p>
<p>Wake up, good prince<br />
I would like to give you all<br />
My dreams and my youth<br />
Break the spell of the fairy tale</p>
<p>Wake up</p>
<p>A new morning, a morning dawning over tears<br />
A heart sees, sees all that the eye can&#8217;t see<br />
