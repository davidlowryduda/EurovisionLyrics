Like an injured bird with golden feathers<br />
You go on stage<br />
And I see, I see, that you are happy</p>
<p>Sing for me, just sing, Primadonna<br />
Sing with an injured soul, Primadonna<br />
Dying every time</p>
<p>Laugh into the face of your destiny, Primadonna<br />
For you it isn&#8217;t new, Primadonna<br />
To play the terrible and easy part, to be a star</p>
<p>And with your tired glance that is crowned with tears<br />
You look into this hall<br />
And you probably see the dream that is just an illusion</p>
<p>Here it is, the last combat, Primadonna<br />
The combat with your destiny, Primadonna</p>
<p>Laugh into the face of your destiny, Primadonna<br />
For you it isn&#8217;t new, Primadonna<br />
To play the terrible and foolish part<br />
To stay alone forever</p>
<p>Give me the force, oh heaven, to drain the cup<br />
There, where nobody has ever been, she had already drunk the wine<br />
They shouted &#8216;Bravo&#8217; to her, for this strange farce<br />
I&#8217;m raising my glass to the grand final</p>
<p>Bravo! Primadonna! Bravo!<br />
