<p>Love, shine a light in every corner of my heart<br />
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry<br />
Light up the magic in every little part<br />
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts</p>
<p>Love, shine a light in every corner of my dream<br />
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry<br />
Like the mighty river flowin&#8217; from the stream<br />
Let our love shine a light in every corner of my dream</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re all gonna shine a light together<br />
All shine a light to light the way<br />
Brothers and sisters in every little part<br />
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts</p>
<p>Love, shine a light in every corner of the world<br />
Let the love light carry, let the love light carry<br />
Light up the magic for every boy and girl<br />
Let our love shine a light in every corner of the world</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re all gonna shine a light together<br />
All shine a light to light the way<br />
Brothers and sisters in every little part<br />
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts</p>
<p>And we&#8217;re all gonna shine a light together<br />
All shine a light to light the way<br />
Brothers and sisters in every little part<br />
Let our love shine a light in every corner of our hearts</p>
<p>Shine a light in every corner of our hearts</p>
