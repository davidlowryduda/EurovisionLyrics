<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
London, Paris, Rome became empty words<br />
I walked the wide and golden road, blinded by love<br />
False acquaintances, revolved around me alone<br />
I had some caviar, it&#8217;s all too late now</p>
<p>For I take my final dance<br />
And bid my life farewell in style<br />
Yet I never regret a thing<br />
Never regret</p>
<p>Crystal champagne, pearls, porcelain<br />
Diamonds for dinner, love for dessert<br />
If I love today, it will be in the papers tomorrow<br />
I take a bubblebath, drown my sorrows</p>
<p>And I take my final dance<br />
And that&#8217;s how I bid my life farewell in style<br />
Yet I never regret a thing<br />
Never regret</p>
<p>All that I get today, has gone away tomorrow</p>
<p>So I take my final dance<br />
And that&#8217;s how I bid my life farewell in style<br />
Yet I never regret a thing<br />
Never regret<br />
