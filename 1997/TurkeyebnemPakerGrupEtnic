The days don&#8217;t pass without you<br />
The nights are again without you<br />
Ah&#8230; where are you my love? With whom are you?<br />
I couldn&#8217;t dare to ask you, so listen</p>
<p>Is this the end of this crazy love?<br />
Without asking that I love you<br />
Without ending the pain, without ending the night<br />
Without going onto the roads, I can find you</p>
<p>Is he my darling, has he got a name?<br />
Without asking that I know you<br />
Without meeting, without talking<br />
Without smiling to your face, I love you</p>

<p>(You had better ask it) Has he got a name?<br />
(Really) Does he love me?<br />
(You had better learn it) Is there an end to it?<br />
(In silence) I love you</p>
