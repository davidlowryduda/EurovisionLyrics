<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I see a girl dance through the night<br />
Smiling so all the hearts stop<br />
Even though I walked through fire and water<br />
She touches me like nobody else</p>
<p>And if she falls for me everything will change<br />
For she&#8217;ll see that the man she waited for<br />
It is me, it could be she and I</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I&#8217;ll have the angel the whole of heaven looks for<br />
And the only woman I want to have again</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I become that man she sees in her dreams<br />
All the others have lost<br />
She can never love without me</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t dare to meet her looks<br />
Show that my heart is on fire<br />
How will I ever catch this girl<br />
Ask before she disappears</p>
<p>Even though other men could die for the her sake<br />
I understand what nobody sees<br />
What she wants, it is only me</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I&#8217;ll have the angel the whole of heaven looks for<br />
And the only woman I want to have again</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I become that man she sees in her dreams<br />
All the others have lost<br />
She can never love without me</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve nothing left to live for<br />
Nothing is worth anything unless we find each other<br />
We become one</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I&#8217;ll have the angel the whole of heaven looks for<br />
And the only woman I want to have again</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I become that man she sees in her dreams<br />
All the others have lost<br />
She can never love without&#8230;</p>
<p>If only she loves me<br />
I become that man she sees in her dreams<br />
She can never love without me<br />
