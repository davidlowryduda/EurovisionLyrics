Why do you always hide yourself in yesterday?<br />
When you disappear there you&#8217;ll stay disappeared<br />
Finding you for the hundredth time already<br />
The flaws between us have become cracks, I see<br />
But if I give up, you&#8217;ll be lost for good</p>
<p>On this forbidden land I feel myself again<br />
I&#8217;m looking for you and again there&#8217;s a border between us<br />
This forbidden land hides you from me like fog<br />
Sometime it will disappear from our way</p>
<p>When I can&#8217;t find you<br />
And while looking even a day falls short<br />
You may lie down next to me<br />
You won&#8217;t recognise me, won&#8217;t hear, won&#8217;t see<br />
Still I understand you, you linger in yesterday again</p>
<p>On this forbidden land I feel myself again<br />
I&#8217;m looking for you and again there&#8217;s a border between us<br />
This forbidden land hides you from me like fog<br />
Sometime it will disappear from our way</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll bring you from the forbidden land<br />
I promise you, I will fetch you</p>
<p>(This forbidden land, I feel myself again) From the forbidden land<br />
(I&#8217;m looking for you and again there&#8217;s a border between us)<br />
Forbidden land (This forbidden land)<br />
Can&#8217;t keep you (Can&#8217;t keep you forever)<br />
The forbidden land will vanish from between us<br />
