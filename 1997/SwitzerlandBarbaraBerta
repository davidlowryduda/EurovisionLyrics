Man, look within, what moves you<br />
And makes you feel a bit lost<br />
In this enormous universe made of so many things</p>
<p>Too many words, spoken to speak, never to be understood<br />
What keeps you away<br />
From what&#8217;s within reach but unreachable</p>
<p>Inside of me, I make room because<br />
Inside of me, I need you<br />
Inside of me, inside of me<br />
I keep a place for you<br />
Who needs me<br />
You need me</p>
<p>Man, open your mind<br />
Don&#8217;t hesitate to unveal your good and bad sides<br />
Also errors have their value, they help one to grow</p>
<p>Inside of me, I make room because (Because)<br />
Inside of me, I need you<br />
Inside of me, inside of me<br />
I keep a place for you, who needs me</p>
<p>Inside of me, I take a breath because<br />
Inside of me, I&#8217;ve been running to you<br />
Inside of me, inside of me<br />
I want you even when you&#8217;re different to me<br />
You&#8217;re different to me</p>
<p>Man, how many misunderstandings<br />
What reasons keep us so far away from each other<br />
When within reach you&#8217;ve got the incredible?<br />
