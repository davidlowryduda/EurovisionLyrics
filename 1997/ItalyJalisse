Ah&#8230; ah&#8230; ah&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for a thousand excuses from you, as always<br />
You&#8217;re a river of words, where I drown too<br />
How great you are, but this talking from a talk show<br />
What does it have to do with us?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying the only remedy that I&#8217;ve been using for a while<br />
I close my ears to the story that I&#8217;ve heard before<br />
It&#8217;s the way you are, by now I should limit myself<br />
Saying yes to you</p>
<p>Rivers of words, rivers of words between us<br />
Sometime they will take us away<br />
I&#8217;ll give you my heart, I&#8217;ll give you my heart, if you want<br />
If you can, speak to it now<br />
Speak to it now, ah&#8230; </p>
<p>You&#8217;re shouting in a way that I don&#8217;t understand anymore<br />
I&#8217;m losing your respect, saying goodbye would be better<br />
Like in a movie, the classic movie<br />
Where she will do something foolish</p>
<p>Rivers of words, rivers of words between us<br />
Sometime they will take us away<br />
I&#8217;ll give you my heart, I&#8217;ll give you my heart, if you want<br />
If you can, speak to it now</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to hold a picture<br />
Feeling how it&#8217;s going inside me<br />
A silence from you with more complicity<br />
I&#8217;d like&#8230;</p>
<p>Rivers of words, rivers of words between us<br />
Sometime they will take us away<br />
I&#8217;ll give you my heart, I&#8217;ll give you my heart, if you want<br />
If you can, speak to it now</p>
<p>Rivers of words, rivers of words between us<br />
Sometime they will take us away<br />
I&#8217;ll give you my heart, I&#8217;ll give you my heart, if you want<br />
If you can, speak to it now<br />
Speak to it now</p>
<p>(Rivers of words, rivers of words between us) Oh&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ll give you my heart, I&#8217;ll give you my heart, if you want<br />
If you can, speak to it now</p>
<p>Rivers of words<br />
