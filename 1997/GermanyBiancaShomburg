Sometimes time ran through my fingers<br />
And sometimes it just wouldn&#8217;t go by<br />
But time heals many wounds<br />
And often, in difficult moments<br />
I wished that I could turn back time, because</p>
<p>Time, time, where does the time go?<br />
Time, time, when is it the right time?<br />
Who knows what&#8217;ll happen next?<br />
Who knows where the road will lead us?<br />
Tell me, where are you?</p>
<p>Time, time, what else will happen during this time<br />
To me?</p>
<p>I prayed for a bit of luck<br />
And cried for the times gone by<br />
But there was one question<br />
Which no one here was able to answer:<br />
Can we live happily in peace? â€“ No</p>
<p>Time, time, where does the time go?<br />
Time, time, when is it the right time?<br />
Where will I be tomorrow?<br />
In the end, will I be alone?<br />
And where are you?</p>
<p>(Time, time, where does the time go?)<br />
How quickly time goes by<br />
(Time, time, when is it the right time?)<br />
How quickly the wind turns</p>
<p>Who knows what&#8217;ll happen next?<br />
Who knows where the road will lead us?<br />
Tell me, where are you?</p>
<p>Time, time, even if the road is long<br />
All I need is a little time<br />
