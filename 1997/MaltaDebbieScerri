<p>Each time I hear the music play<br />
It makes me feel that way<br />
The memories we once shared come back inside me</p>
<p>And when I hear that same old song<br />
Throughout the whole night long<br />
The pains that we&#8217;ve been through all fade away</p>
<p>Let me fly and I will reach way up high<br />
I will climb the steps that lead to the sky<br />
Where the clouds caress your face with my tears<br />
Let me try &#8211; I can fly</p>
<p>Let me hear the songs that I never played<br />
I will find the keys that open the gate<br />
Of my dreams, which light the flame in my life<br />
If they die, I can&#8217;t fly</p>
<p>Hahah, hahahah<br />
Hahah, hahah, hahah</p>
<p>And when the music stops to play<br />
The thrill soon fades away<br />
Dark shadows from the past will haunt my day</p>
<p>Let me fly and I will reach way up high<br />
I will climb the steps that lead to the sky<br />
Where the clouds caress your face with my tears<br />
Let me try &#8211; I can fly</p>
<p>Let me hear the songs that I never played<br />
I will find the keys that open the gate<br />
Of my dreams, which light the flame in my life<br />
If they die, I can&#8217;t fly</p>
<p>Till I die, let me fly</p>
