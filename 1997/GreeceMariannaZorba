Slowly, slowly<br />
Like the flame&#8217;s figure, you cast your spells<br />
Shyly, shyly<br />
You close your moon-shaped eyes</p>
<p>Dance again to the beat of my heart<br />
And like a caravan I&#8217;ll follow the stars<br />
Dance, pearl of the desert<br />
And through your body I&#8217;ll resurrect myself</p>
<p>Dance again to the beat of my heart<br />
And like a caravan I&#8217;ll follow the stars<br />
Dance, pearl of the desert<br />
And through your body I&#8217;ll resurrect myself</p>
<p>Softly, softly<br />
I saw the night melting<br />
Palely, palely<br />
She laid her naked hands upon me</p>
<p>Dance again to the beat of my heart<br />
And like a caravan I&#8217;ll follow the stars<br />
Dance, pearl of the desert<br />
And through your body I&#8217;ll resurrect myself</p>
<p>Dance again to the beat of my heart<br />
And like a caravan I&#8217;ll follow the stars<br />
Dance, pearl of the desert<br />
And through your body I&#8217;ll resurrect myself</p>
<p>Dance again to the beat of my heart<br />
And like a caravan I&#8217;ll follow the stars<br />
Dance, pearl of the desert<br />
And through your body I&#8217;ll resurrect myself<br />
