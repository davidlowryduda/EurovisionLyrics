My eyes open: the world comes into being<br />
Above me &#8211; heaven, an orchard in front<br />
Green apples&#8217; smell and taste<br />
And all is so simple</p>
<p>You must truly live, to fool the time<br />
You must beautifully live, you live only once<br />
You must live in admiration: love, imagine and dream<br />
You must fool the time, to save true life</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a grain of sand in a sand-glass<br />
A boat stray among the reefs<br />
A rain drop, a thoughtful cane among the grass<br />
But I am</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a spark, a gasp of wind<br />
a trail of light running up the stars<br />
I&#8217;m a while trying to beat the time<br />
But I am</p>
<p>I strain my ears to hear it play<br />
Music in me, in music &#8211; I<br />
Before big silence engulfs me<br />
I want to sing out, to sing that</p>
<p>You must truly live, to fool the time<br />
You must live in admiration, life happens only once</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a grain of sand in a sand-glass<br />
A boat stray among the reefs<br />
A rain drop, a thoughtful cane among the grass<br />
But I am</p>
<p>I am</p>
<p>Life is a road, life is a dream<br />
What will be later &#8211; I know, I don&#8217;t know<br />
Don&#8217;t ask, you will see when<br />
An ends comes of the road, of life and dreams</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a grain of sand in a sand-glass<br />
A boat stray among the reefs<br />
A rain drop, a thoughtful cane among the grass<br />
But I am</p>
<p>But I am (I&#8217;m a spark, a gasp of wind)<br />
I&#8217;m (A trail of light running up to the stars)<br />
I&#8217;m a while trying to beat the time<br />
But I am<br />
