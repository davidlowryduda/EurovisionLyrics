Today is a sad day, my love<br />
We realised we came to the end<br />
End of a road, end of a love<br />
And we both realised it</p>
<p>It was wonderful to spend<br />
Those unforgettable, happy days<br />
Our flame dies out, our love dies out<br />
But our heart will always feel&#8230;</p>
<p>That you&#8217;re someone special<br />
That no one will be the same<br />
That&#8217;s why I ask you</p>
<p>That there won&#8217;t be grudge if we meet again, love<br />
There were so many happy days<br />
You gave me so much love<br />
Swear it to me, without grudge</p>
<p>I wish you all the best<br />
May the things we learnt help us both<br />
Goodbye, sweetheart, you know that<br />
I&#8217;ll feel for you&#8230;</p>
<p>That you&#8217;re someone special<br />
That no one will be the same<br />
That&#8217;s why I ask you</p>
<p>That there won&#8217;t be grudge if we meet again, love<br />
There were so many happy days<br />
You gave me so much love<br />
Just swear to me, please</p>
<p>May there never be grudge if we meet again, love<br />
There&#8217;ll always be something special between you and me<br />
That between us both everything will stay<br />
Without grudge, without grudge</p>
<p>If you search a friend<br />
I&#8217;ll be by your side</p>
<p>Between you and me<br />
May there never be grudge<br />
There&#8217;ll always be something special between you and me<br />
Without grudge<br />
