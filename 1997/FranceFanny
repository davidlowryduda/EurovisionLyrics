Often we ride on the merry-go-round in the wrong way<br />
We discover love, but without the beautiful manners<br />
We invent stories, stories to get away from it<br />
We make up our memory to avoid thinking</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the water of a stream, it pours without stopping<br />
Everything we found beautiful, had to get broken<br />
It&#8217;s not all that bad, except that we feel left out<br />
Of the starshine and that we don&#8217;t want to give anymore</p>
<p>Feelings, useful dream feelings<br />
Used for tender words of love<br />
Feelings, sentimental suffering<br />
As light as a silence<br />
A game of tears for sleepless nights</p>
<p>Tender suppositions<br />
Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the crime weapon, need the print to prove<br />
To prove that it&#8217;s bad or good for us<br />
Everything which is ugly, is displayed<br />
So nobody remembers anymore what was good</p>
<p>And it makes memories strangely precise<br />
Things we can write or arrange in life<br />
We don&#8217;t really know what is false or true<br />
But what&#8217;s important of all this, is that we did it</p>
<p>Feelings, useful dream feelings<br />
Used for tender words of love<br />
Feelings, sentimental suffering<br />
As light as a silence<br />
A game of tears for sleepless nights</p>
<p>Oh, feelings<br />
