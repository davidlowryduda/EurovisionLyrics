It still feels like yesterday<br />
When everyone was singing: <em>&#8220;Make love, not war&#8221;</em><br />
And the world had longer hair<br />
It feels like yesterday</p>
<p>Being brothers and sisters was in<br />
<em>California dreamin&#8217;</em><br />
Important questions and an open mind<br />
The answers were <em>blowin&#8217; in the wind</em></p>
<p>Oh&#8230; time for love in San Francisco<br />
A dream of peace, a spring of youth<br />
No guns, <em>no war, no disco</em><br />
Just lovely flowers in your hair</p>
<p>When everybody surfed on a good vibration<br />
USA got their man on the moon<br />
Jimi Hendrix played fire and passion<br />
At Woodstock for a new generation</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; then there was a strong feeling to be young and free<br />
Life had plenty of time<br />
And the whole world had longer hair<br />
It feels like yesterday</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; time for love in San Francisco<br />
A dream of peace, a spring of youth<br />
Ooh yeah&#8230; no guns, <em>no war, no disco</em><br />
Just lovely flowers in your hair</p>
<p>All over the earth Lennon&#8217;s song was heard:<br />
<em>&#8220;Love, love, love&#8221;</em><br />
With the message that love sets everyone free<br />
If we don&#8217;t let it pass us by</p>
<p>Time for love in San Fran&#8230;<br />
Time for love in San Francisco<br />
A dream of peace, a spring of youth<br />
Ooh yeah&#8230; no guns, <em>no war, no disco</em><br />
Just lovely flowers in your&#8230;</p>
<p>Just lovely flowers in you hair<br />
Oh yeah&#8230;<br />
