A language I don't understand
You speak, I listen, I'm your friend
(You hypnotise me)
Take my hand
A million faces tied in chains
You ride a black horse in the rain
(You hypnotise me)
Don't escape
No more, no more, no more, no more
Cause we are all
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
You heal me, you fill me
Ignite a flame within me
(You hypnotise me) Mmm!
I'm begging you, don't escape
No more, no more, no more, no more
Cause we are all
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
Tell me that you understand
Come in close and take my hand
Let's float across the sky line
There's no floor and there's no ceiling
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Cause we are (Cause we are)
Cause we are (Cause we are)
We are, we are, we are
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling
We are made of stars
We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars
