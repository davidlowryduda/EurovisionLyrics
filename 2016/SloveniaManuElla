Allay
Blue and red
Like I'm watching you and me
Every little thing you said
Led me to fall in love with you
Then you tried to fix me and I wasn't strong
But you are not a composer, I am not your song
Strange chords, different words
How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful days and stormy weather
Allay, allay, allay
Cause blue is blue and red is red
Our past is spinning in my head
But now the colour doesn't matter
You feel blue and and I am better
Now I'm changed
Now I'm stronger than before
Ain't never touching me no more
I'm okay, I'll find my way
How can I mix red and blue together?
Beautiful days and stormy weather
Allay, allay, allay
Cause blue is blue and red is red
Our past is spinning in my head
But now the colour doesn't matter
You feel blue and and I am better
Allay, allay, allay
Allay, allay, allay
