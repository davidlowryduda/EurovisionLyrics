Every night
Before I sleep, a shiver down my spine
Thoughts align
What can I do to make you listen?
Like a northern light
You're dancing over every borderline
Passing every sign
Between reality and fiction
Every single promise that you ever made
Spinning in my mind like a hurricane
Baby, yes, I hear your mayday
Mayday
I'll be your icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
You go astray
Just like a polaroid you fade away
I'll be your partner
And liberate you from your prison
Baby, yes, I hear your mayday
Mayday
I'll be your icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
We're way too young to say goodbye
Whenever you lose faith just hold the line
It takes a lot of nerve to save a life
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water, frozen water
Icebreaker
When you're stuck in frozen water
Ah!
Frozen water
