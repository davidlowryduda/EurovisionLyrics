<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span>
It's the first time it's happened to me
Before I shut myself in a box
Always a bit distant from the things of life
Because I had never felt them too deeply
And then I felt an emotion
Lighting fast and making itself a path in my chest
Without turning off its voice
And I don't feel tension anymore, only life inside me
No degree of separation
No type of hesitation
There is no longer any division
Between us
We are only a single direction
In this world that moves
There's no degree of separation
I gave less space to the heart and more to reason
Always one step behind and with my soul on alert
And I watched the world from a door that was never fully open
And not from close by
And no, there's no hesitation finally inside me
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>There is no degree of separation
There is no degree of hesitation
There is no degree of space between us
Live in love</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We are stars aligned together
Dancing through the sky, we are shining</em></font>
No degree of separation
No degree of separation
In this world that moves
And then I felt an emotion
Lighting fast and making itself a path in my chest
Without turning off its voice
