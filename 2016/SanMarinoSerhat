I want to stay with you tonight
Far from every sight and every fear
I got to be inside your mind
And hide into your arms
I need you more and more each day
I've got to say I'm addicted
We'll sail together through the skies
Your eyes never told me lies
I didn't know that I'm falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn't know that you're warm like the sun
Our life has just begun
I didn't know you're the one for me
I thought I'd never find
I didn't know that you wished for the moon
To provide me the light
(Oh.. oh! oh!)
(Oh.. oh! oh!)
(I didn't know that you freezing the time)
(Just to make you all mine)
(I didn't know with every beat of your heart)
(I'm melting into you)
I need you more and more each day
I've got to say I'm addicted
We'll sail together through the skies
Your eyes never told me lies
I didn't know that I'm falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn't know that you're warm like the sun
Our life has just begun
I didn't know you're the one for me
I thought I'd never find
I didn't know that you wished for the moon
To provide me the light
I didn't know that I'm falling for you
And my dreams could come true
I didn't know that you're warm like the sun
Our life has just begun
I didn't know that you freezing the time
Just to make you all mine
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know
(I didn't know)
