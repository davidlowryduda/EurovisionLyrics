Tell me why we always fuel the fire
Why we tend to close our eyes
What's the reason that we keep on hiding?
We can make it if we try
I don't know why we don't care
There's nothing to fear when I know you are there
So let's not wait for someone else
To make it right, make it right
Take my hand and never let go
Side by side we walk an open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step we'll make a new start
Let's be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go and let's be soldiers of love
What's the meaning of a world on fire
And a heart without a soul?
I believe that we can shine a light on
What we already ought to know
So let's not wait for someone else
To make it right, make it right
Take my hand and never let go
Side by side we walk an open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step we'll make a new start
Let's be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go and let's be soldiers of love
Unbreakable, don't let it go
It's an open road, time to let it show
Invincible, gonna climb the wall
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go
Take my hand and never let go
Side by side we walk an open road
Unbreakable with hope in our hearts
Step by step we'll make a new start (Make a new start)
Let's be soldiers of love, soldiers of love
Soldiers of love for life
Take my hand and never let go
Never let go and let's be soldiers of love
