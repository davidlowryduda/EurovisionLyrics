Lost in time, you're miles away
I try to speak or make a sound
The dark surrounds me when you're gone
The dream we had disappeared
Still I believe, I'm holding on
I didn't mean to let you down
We could be the brightest falling
The brightest falling stars
The sky is tumbling
It's coming down, coming down
The wildest fire
Is burning out, out
And when our fall torn us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We're the brightest falling stars
Flashing lights, I close my eyes
I let the sunlight comfort me
When all that's left are memories
We could be the brightest falling stars
The sky is tumbling
It's coming down, coming down
The wildest fire
Is burning out, out
And when our fall torn us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We're the brightest falling stars
(The brightest falling stars)
The thought of us all disappeared
Still I believe, I'm holding on
The sky is tumbling
It's coming down, coming down
The wildest fire
Is burning out, out
And when our fall torn us to pieces
All of our love turned into dust
We're the brightest falling stars
