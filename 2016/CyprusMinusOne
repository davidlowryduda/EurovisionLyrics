Waking up alone like a man that failed
Trapped into the mist of our fairytale
And you know, you know, you know
I'm still inside
I knew it all along but I couldn't tell
This kind of love would lock my heart in jail
And you know, you know, you know
It's doing time
I'm caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under a spotlight, I howl in the moonlight
Howling for you
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on until the morning light
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on, take it on
I've heard it all before, people always say
Time can take the sorrow and the pain away
And you know, you know
This love will never die
I'm caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under a spotlight, I howl in the moonlight
Howling for you
I'm caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under a spotlight, I howl in the moonlight
Howling for you
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on until the morning light
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on, take it on
I cross the oceans, I fly on the skyline
Drive any road that will bring me by your side
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on until the morning light
Take it on, take it on and get me through the night
Take it on, take it on, take it on
Caught in the middle of the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
