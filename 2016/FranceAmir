<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span>
I've looked for a meaning to my existence
It made me leave my innocence behind
I've finished with an unprotected  heart
I've looked for love and recognition
I've paid the price of silence
I am getting hurt and I start over again
You gave me the will to be myself
Gave a meaning to my questions
You've killed the fear that was sleeping here
That was sleeping here in my arms
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song</em></font>
I've looked for a direction, a landmark
Split into two hemispheres
Like a mistake of the universe
I've thrown too many bottles into the sea
I drank so much bitter liqueur
It made my lips as cold as stone
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song</em></font>
Along with our wounds
And our flippancies
It's when we completely lose our faith
That we find a lost paradise inside ourselves
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Oh, you, you, you, you</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
Like the melody of my song</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking, looking for you
Like the melody of my song
Like the melody of my song</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You
You're the one that's making me strong
I'll be looking, looking, looking for you
Giving you love with my song
Giving you love with my song</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>You</em></font>
