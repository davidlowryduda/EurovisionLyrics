Here we are together, you and I, I
Watching lights around us fill the night, night
I was living in the dark
Tried to heal my broken heart until now
Here we are together you and I, I
For a thousand years, through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I've
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
If only I could stay here by your side, side
To promise you forever here tonight, night
There is nothing I can do
That can take my heart from you, always yours
If only I could stay here by your side, side
For a thousand years, through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I've
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
Oh! oh!
Oh! oh!
For a thousand years, through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I've
I've been waiting for this night
I've been waiting for this night
Here we are together, you and I
