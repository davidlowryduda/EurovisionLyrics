I'd crawl through the desert on my hands and knees
Rehearsing my pretty please
Climb the highest mountain if I were sorry
Shout it from the top
Swim under water until my lungs exploded
Walk into the fire if I were sorry
I'd run a thousand miles
Wouldn't stop until I dropped
Wouldn't take a break to breathe
Until I got close enough
Then I'd do it all again
If I really had the chance
But I know deep inside for you
It's just another dance
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
It would be a different story
If I were sorry, if I were sorry oh
I'd hold my breath until my face turned blue
I'd rob a bank and the post office too
Swim across the ocean if I were sorry
I'd take a wow of silence
I wouldn't say a single word
Until you really heard if I were sorry
I'd run a thousand miles
Wouldn't stop until I dropped
Wouldn't take the break to breathe
Until I, I got close enough
If I were sorry
I'd give you all the glory
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
It would be a different story
If I were sorry, oh
Now did you ever realise
That your mistake had a price?
Oh, you threw it all away
Cause you're the devil in disguise
Now would you ever realise
The consequences of your lies?
And would you save the falling tear
Or act as if there's nothing there?
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
If I were sorry
I'd take a vow of silence
I wouldn't say a single word
(If I were sorry)
If I were sorry
I'd be on my hands and knees
Begging pretty please
If I were sorry
But I'm not sorry, no
