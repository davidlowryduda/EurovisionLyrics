Soldier, take off your armour
Show me your heart; this is home
And it's stronger, stronger than water
Deeper than reason, longer than time
Here we are at the end of the movie
I've never felt more alive
It's time to rise
We're the last of our kind
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though
We're the last of our kind
The last of our kind
The last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
We're the last of our kind
This is paradise
Turn off the search light
We're where we belong
Standing tall at the end of the story
Watching worlds collide
It's time to rise
We're the last of our kind
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though
We're the last of our kind
Here we are now with nothing to lose
I know without love we won't pull through
Cause deep in the night
There is a light and it guides us to truth
It's a whole new world
And we're facing the fire
Not afraid of our own ghosts
We're the last of our kind
And we're all that we know
And we're out of our minds
Not afraid to be brave though
We're the last of our kind
The last of our kind
The last of our kind
Not afraid to be brave
We're the last of our kind
