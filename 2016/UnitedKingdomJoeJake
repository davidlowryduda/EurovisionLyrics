Heartbeat, when you're not around it's beating slow
And it's something that I've never know, oh whoa!
I'll be, I'll be the answer you've been waiting for
I'll be the truth that you've been looking for, oh whoa!
You're not alone, we're in this together
All that you want is right here forever
And they don't need to kno-o-ow, oh oh oh
And they don't need to know
You're not alone, we're in this together
All that you want, I'm right here forever
And they don't need to kno-o-ow, oh oh oh
And they don't need to know
You're free, free to let go 'cause I'll be here for you
And when you fall I'll be your parachute, oh whoa!
I, I, I feel like I'm dancing in the sky-y-y
I come alive when I'm with you
I come alive when I'm with you
You're not alone, we're in this together
All that you want is right here forever
And they don't need to kno-o-ow, oh oh oh
And they don't need to know
I, I, I feel like I'm dancing in the sky-y-y
I come alive when I'm with you
I come alive when I'm with you
Don't speak, your smile tells me all I need to know
Your eyes show me where I want to go, oh whoa!
You're not alone, we're in this together
All that you want is right here forever
And they don't need to kno-o-ow, oh oh oh
And they don't need to know
I, I, I feel like I'm dancing in the sky-y-y
I come alive when I'm with you
I come alive when I'm with you
