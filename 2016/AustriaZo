And when you sing, yes I sing as well
When you leap, I'll follow
And when you fly, yes I fly as well
If you leap, I'll follow you
In a land far from here
Searching for paradise
In a land far from here
We sing, we sing
In a land far from here
Searching for paradise
In a land far from here
We sing
And when the road seems to reach a dead-end
Without a doubt I'll follow you
Without a doubt, even if we'll get lost
Without a doubt I'll follow you
In a land far from here
Searching for paradise
In a land far from here
We sing, we sing
In a land far from here
Searching for paradise
In a land far from here
We sing, we sing
We sing and we dance and we laugh
We leap, meeting
In inebriated carelessness
In a land far from here
Searching for paradise
In a land far from here
We sing, we sing
In a land far from here
Searching for paradise
In a land far from here
We sing, we sing
(In a land far from here) In a land
(Searching for paradise) For paradise
(In a land far from here) In a land
We sing, we sing
(In a land far from here)
We sing, we sing, we dance, we dance
(Searching for paradise) In a land
(In a land far from here)
We sing, we sing, we dance, we dance
(We sing) Far from here
