Hello, hello, Mr. Fighter
Look, there we go again
Go-getters don't forsake
They never wallow in their fate
More than a thousand miles until the end
We're never gonna know what lies ahead
We only got today
To learn from our yesterday
I feel alive (Bringing into play)
My whole life (Going all the way)
I'm still alive (And I turn away)
From broken mirrors
I feel alive (When I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won't fix by running, running, running
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies
Hurray, sing it, lala lala!
Go on, singing lala lala!
(Say yay, yay, yay)
You keep on climbing over hills
Right now you're following your dreams
Hurray, sing it, lala lala!
Hurray (Say yay, yay, yay)
Hurray (Say yay, yay, yay)
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Hurray (Say yay, yay, yay)
Hello, hello, Mr. Danger
No need to be afraid
I know by heart my shades
I got the light between my breaks
More than a thousand wounds upon my hands
Of every time I fought them face to face
We go through our mistakes
To find the way to go back straight
I feel alive (Bringing into play)
My whole life (Going all the way)
I'm still alive (And I turn away)
From broken mirrors
I feel alive (When I dare to say)
I wanna fight
Won't fix by running
No no no no no, won't fix by running
Come on and raise your battle cry
You are the one who never dies
(Hurray, sing it, lala lala!)
(Go on, singing lala lala!)
You keep on climbing over hills
Right now you're following your dreams
Hurray, sing it lalalala!
Hurray (Say yay, yay, yay)
Hurray (Say yay, yay, yay)
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Hurray (Say yay, yay, yay)
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Hurray, you gotta say yay
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Duh-duh duh-duh duh-duh-duh
Duh-duh duh-duh-duh
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Hurray, you gotta say yay
(Say yay, yay, yay)
Raise up your battle cry
Say yay, yay, yay
