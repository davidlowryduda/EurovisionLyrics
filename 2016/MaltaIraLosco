Ah! ah!
I've been fading into grey
Trying to be someone
Trying to please someone
I've been painting bitter blue
Always hitting walls
Always trying to break the fall
I'm not perfect but I'm A-OK
Chasing off the clouds and lock the blues away
I lock the pain away
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get you out of my heart
I can't get enough of your love
Cause I, I, I
I feel like I can walk on water
On water, on water
And now I'm gonna walk on water
On water, on water
Feels like I can walk on water
I've been trying hard to hear
What my heart wants to say
Letting it lead the way
I'm not perfect but I'm A-OK
Chasing off the clouds and lock the blues away
I lock the pain away
I can't get enough of your love
I can't get you out of my heart
I can't get enough of your love
Cause I, I, I
I feel like I can walk on water
On water, on water
And now I'm gonna walk on
(Oh oh oh!) All I wanna do is
(Oh oh oh!) Keep walking on water
(Oh oh oh!) All I wanna do is
Walk on water, ooh!
I can't get enough of your love
Cause I, I, I
I feel like I can walk on water
On water, on water
And now I'm gonna walk on water
On water, on water
Feels like I can walk on water
