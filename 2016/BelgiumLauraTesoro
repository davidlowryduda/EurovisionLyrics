Don't ask me why the sun is shining
Long after the day is done
The evening falls, the bright lights
Bring out the best in me, I see
Massive walls weighing down the people all around
But they don't seem to mind at all
And I will try to stand my ground, won't be bound
And bring out the best in me
What's the pressure?
You will grow, you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It's in your mind, live your life instead
Don't ask me why the sun is shining
Brings me all the joy and hope in life
Even though these rules they, they try'na take over me
Try'na take over me, I see
Massive walls weighing down people all around
But they don't seem to mind at all
I will try to stand my ground, won't be bound
And bring out the best in me
What's the pressure?
You will grow, you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It's in your mind, live your life instead
What's the pressure?
This is fiction
It's in your mind, live your life the best
You gotta do what you wanna do
You gotta be who you wanna be
So tell me, what's the pressure?
What's the pressure?
And this is fiction
It's in your mind, live your life instead
Now what's the pressure?
You will grow and you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It's in your mind, live your life the best
