This tale of love
Larger than dreams
It may take a lifetime
To understand what it means
So many tears
All the craziness and rage
Tale of love
The message is love can bring change
Cause it's you, only you
You I feel
And I, oh I
I know in my soul this is real
And that's why I love you, oh oh
Yes, I love you, oh oh
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you, my heart
But comes a day when it's not enough
What you have and the time is up
But it's hard to turn a new page
In this tale, sweet tale of love
You will find peace in your heart that you crave
(Oh oh oh oh oh! oh oh oh oh!)
(Oh oh oh oh oh! oh oh oh oh!)
Whoa! ah ah ah ah! yeah!
Yeah yeah!
And that's why I love you, oh oh
Yes, I love you, oh oh
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you, my heart
And that's why I love you, oh oh
Yes, I love you, oh oh
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you, my heart
And I'd fight for you
Give my life for you, my heart
