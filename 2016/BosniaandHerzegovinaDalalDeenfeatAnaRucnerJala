<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span>
I will need your body
When I close my eyes
Everything around me is white
Even the grey walls
I have nowhere to go back to
I only believe in you
I will pay all my debts
I swear to love
Love is a magic circle
Everybody takes their turn
Everybody pays their debts
Love is all that we have
Everybody chooses their own sin
We forgive each other
Forgive
I need your body so much
When I close my eyes
The heart swore by you
How can I forgive you?
I have nowhere to go back to
I only believe in you
I will pay all my debts
I swear to love
Instead of being a captain, I chose to be a pirate
Instead of being happy, I chose to be sad in spite
My story's a roulette, I only pay in but I don't know how to cash out
I'm cursed by her eyes, I don't know how to laugh anymore
Then she lures my with her warmth after two or three glasses of wine
But she's not the one who will give me a son tomorrow
But no one knows how to touch me so magically
I'm tragically drunk again because the devil will give me no peace
Love is a magic circle
Everybody takes their turn
Everybody pays their debts
Love is all that we have
Everybody chooses their own sin
We forgive each other
Forgive
