It's getting late and be that as it may
I turn to you, I turn to you
We might seem so obvious to me
But not to you, not to you
We ain't got all night
To find out what is right
So let's go undecided till we know
The only way to go
Is let your feelings show
See all your walls come down
And just hit play
Cause that's the only way
To find out if it's love
That we're fallin', we're fallin' into
I didn't know what to do
But now I'm good as new
Cause I'm stronger, much stronger with you
Some might say it's an ordinary day
But not for me, not for me
If you feel your senses disagree
Bear with me, bear with me
We ain't got all night
To find out what is right
So let's go undecided till we know
It's the only way to see
If we were meant to be
Let all your walls come down
And just hit play
Cause that's the only way
To find out if it's love
That we're fallin', we're fallin' into
I didn't know what to do
But now I'm good as new
Cause I'm stronger, much stronger with you
Some might say it's an ordinary day
But not for me, not for me
And I  hit play
(Cause that's the only way)
(To find out) If it's love
We're fallin' into, into
I didn't know what to do
But now I'm good as new
Cause I'm stronger, much stronger with you
