Lightning strikes on the sea
Breaking waves around me
Stormy tides and I feel
My ship capsizing
Out of sight, saving shore
Ever gone, evermore
Ropes untied, rain that pours
The water's rising
In devastating times I keep this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night
Cause there is a light guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade
I know that I'll find your lighthouse, your lighthouse
I know that I'll find your!
Harbour's near, no more fear
Wall of clouds disappears
So I steer to the pier
In tears, arriving
No devastating times, I kept this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night
Cause there is a light guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade
I know that I'll find your!
I know that I'll find your!
There is a light
Keeping me safe when oceans rage
There in the sky, hiding away
Never to die and fade
I know that Iâ€™ll find your, your lighthouse
Your lighthouse, your lighthouse
Your lighthouse, your lighthouse
