<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span>
Of all the small things this one is the worthiest
Of all the great thoughts of my whole world
And when I turn back you are always there
Like a hidden shadow, silent divine flower
For everything that you gave me
From my heart I thank you
For all the past times
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
Dona, Dona, look at me
And smile for me, oh!
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
My strength, light, glow
You make me strong, you know
Oh Dona, believe
Believe in me
Of all the small things this one is the worthiest
Of all the great thoughts of my whole world
I know whom I belong to and where joy awaits me
On small clouds I walk on pearly stairs
For everything that you gave me
From my heart I thank you
For all the past times
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
Dona, Dona, look at me
And smile for me, oh!
Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona
My strength, light, glow
You make me strong, you know
Oh Dona, believe
Believe in me
(Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona)
(Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona, Dona)
Dona
Believe in me
