I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Do you remember when you were younger
You didn't worry for a day
Now all the questions and no direction
They make our reasons insane
It's time you released yourself
Before you can let go
I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Free, leave all the madness behind, far behind
You feel like you ate the poison
It's time to heal you from the pain
I know that you've been the hunted
I want to free you again
It's time you released yourself
Before you can let go
I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Free, leave all the madness behind, far behind
If I can fly then you can
If I can fly then you can fly
If I can fly then you can fly
If I can fly (If I can fly)
If I can fly
I will help you learn how to fly, how to fly
Free, leave all the madness behind, far behind
All behind
