Don't be afraid
It's only dark till the world turns round
Just don't look down
If you're afraid of the higher ground
Hold on to me and let me hold on to you
We don't look back, we let it slide out of view
And we can make it if we break out beyond these clouds
We'll be standing out
In the sunlight
We stay together, we'll live forever
In the sunlight
It's now or never, you know you better
Just touch who you wanna, kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners, love like beginners
Dance like you mean it, sing like you feel it
Everything's better standing out in the sun
Stop for a moment
Just to take in the sights and sounds
(Oh oh oh oh!)
Hold on to me and let me hold on to you
We don't look back, we let it slide out of view
There's no tomorrow so let's live in the here and now
We'll be standing out
In the sunlight
We stay together, we'll live forever
In the sunlight
It's now or never, you know you better
Just touch who you wanna, kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners, love like beginners
Dance like you mean it, sing like you feel it
Everything's better standing out in the sun
Come turn me inside out
Upside down, I'll be your lover boy
Turn the music loud
We can join the crowd
In the sunlight
We stay together, we'll live forever
In the sunlight
It's now or never, you know you better
Just touch who you wanna, kiss who you gotta
Fight like we're winners, love like beginners
Dance like you mean it, sing like you feel it
Everything's better standing out in the sun
