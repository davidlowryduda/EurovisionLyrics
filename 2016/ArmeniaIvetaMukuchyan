Hey, it's me
Look, I know it might sound strange
But suddenly I'm not the same I used to be
It's like I've stepped out of space and time and come alive
Guess this is what itâ€™s all about
Cause when it touched me the world went silent
Calm before the storm reaches me
The ground in motion set off all sirens
You took over my heartbeat, beat, beat, beat
It's taking over me
You shook my life like an earthquake
Now I'm waking up
You gave me faith, now I can break
Every single wall
You prove we can do it all
When all is out of love
(You) Oh, like a lovewave
Spread a love wave and my heart goes
Ba-ba-da-bu-whoa-oh-oh
Caught in a downward spiral
I lost my soul in my dreams
I would give up and lose all trials
When one moment changed everything
Without even a single warning
I'm not who I was before
A chain reaction with no returning
Now watch me craving for more
It's taking over me
It's taking, it's taking over me
(You) You're like a love wave
Shook my life like an earthquake
Now I'm waking up
(You) You're like a love wave
Gave me faith, now I can break
Every single wall
(You) You're like a love wave
Prove we can do it all
When all is out of love
(You) Ooh yeah!
Spread a love wave and my heart goes
Ba-ba-da-bu-whoa-oh-oh
