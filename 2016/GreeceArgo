Planet Earth 2016
No matter what they do our generation will endure
I have experienced being a refugee when I was young
And I step forward even when I look behind
I get up in the morning and I meet the guys
We're on fire, off we head for the Utopian Land
In these parts of the world we found no place to stand
Let's try and paint it red in the Utopian Land
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We're the rise in the rising sun
Dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
Join with us for a Utopian Land</em></font>
Hop hop, this is our very own hip hop
We got the tickets and we're off to the airport
Waiting for the plane for two hours straight
I got some pickles and my friend has got the drinks
Hop, vodka it is, then, and whatever else time brings
Grandma's frying fish and we're on the plane dancing
It won't be long now before we're gone
It is dusk here and we're heading to the dawn
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We're the rise in the rising sun
Dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
Fight with us for a Utopian Land</em></font>
It is dusk here and we're heading to the dawn, dawn
It is dusk here and we're heading to the dawn
And we're heading, we're heading, we're heading to the dawn
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We're the rise in the rising sun
Dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
Join with us for a Utopian Land</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We're the rise in the rising sun
Dance with us and have some fun
We're the rise in the rising sun
