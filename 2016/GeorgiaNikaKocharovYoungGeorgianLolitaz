When I came to
Your smell on me
I reached around the bed
And grabbed a cigarette out of your bag
Sound of you breathing
Feel of your skin
Brought back some memories
I never thought this all could happen to me
Ten hours are missing
From memory
I vaguely can recall
Pain and pleasure mixing in one bowl
My mind is spinning
I know the bliss
One million miles away
My flesh and bones are dreaming in a haze
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will the sin
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will the sin
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will the sin
Stains of mud on your skin
On your skin, on your skin, so come on
When I came to
Your smell on me
I reached around the bed
And grabbed a cigarette out of your bag
