The story of us, is it already told?
Let's tear the book apart, start to rewrite it all
We're already gone but still in this together
Like a dragon to his gold we're still holding on
Our life won't wait for us to live
We don't need a lifetime to figure out what we miss
The love we get is the love we give
A money chest full of love but we hid the key
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We're lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who's scared now
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We're playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who's scared now
Can't we get an alternate ending?
Can't we get an alternate ending? Oh!
Somehow we will change everything that we touch
But we held on too tight and changed it too much
We sweep up this love, put the pieces back together
And if we find them all can we bring this to life?
Our life won't wait for us to live
We don't need a lifetime to figure out what we miss
The love we get is the love we give
A money chest full of love but we hid the key
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We're lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who's scared now
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We're playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who's scared now
Can't we get an alternate ending?
Can't we get an alternate ending? Oh!
Can't we get an alternate ending?
Can't we get an alternate ending? Oh!
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We're lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who's scared now
This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We're playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who's scared now
This is the ghost of you (Ah!)
Haunting the ghost of me
We're lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who's scared now
This is the ghost of you (Tell me who's scared now)
Haunting the ghost of me
We're playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who's scared now
