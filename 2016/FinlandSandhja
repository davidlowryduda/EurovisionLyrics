Please believe me when I say
There's nothing harder than the strife
When heavy waters try to break you
You will be singing for life
When you feel like your world is falling down
And darkness has taken your sight
There's no need to be carrying a frown
I'll help you sing it out tonight
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, never make me fade away
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, huh huh huh
Oh! I'm gonna sing it
Oh! yeah
Oh! I'm gonna sing it
Oh! I'm gonna sing it away
So if you're focused you can make it
You'll feel like nothing can steer you off your course
When fear will try to make you cave in
Remember that love is the source
When you feel like your dreams are beaten down
And your fire is losing its light
There's no need to be carrying a frown
I'll help you sing it out tonight 
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, never make me fade away
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, huh huh huh
Oh! I'm gonna sing it
Oh! yeah
Oh! I'm gonna sing it
Oh! I'm gonna sing it away
When all of the walls come crashing down
When you try to scream but can't make a sound
Don't you worry about it, don't you worry about it
You just gotta sing it away
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, never make me fade away
Sing it away, all my troubles away
Sing it away, huh huh huh
Oh! I'm gonna sing it
Oh! yeah
Oh! I'm gonna sing it
Oh! I'm gonna sing it away
