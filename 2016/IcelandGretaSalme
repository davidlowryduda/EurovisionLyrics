Can you hear them calling?
Oh, they're calling out tonight
Now the skies are burning
Oh, they burn so bright
We shiver as we step into the cold, cold night
Then we're running, we are running now
I hear them calling me, I hear them whispering
They're singing: &#8220;Now we are coming home&#8221;
I hear them calling me, I hear them howling
Singing: &#8220;Now we are coming home&#8221;
Oh! oh!
See the shadows dancing
Oh, they dance for us tonight
And as I'm tossing and I'm turning
Oh, they come alive
We shiver as we step into the cold, cold night
Then we're running, we are running now
I hear them calling me, I hear them whispering
They're singing: &#8220;Now we are coming home&#8221;
I hear them calling me, I hear them howling
Singing: &#8220;Now we are coming home&#8221;
Oh! oh!
Can you hear them? I hear them calling me, oh!
Can you hear them? I hear them calling me, oh!
I hear them calling me, I hear them whispering
I hear them calling me, we're coming home
I hear them calling me, I hear them whispering
I hear them calling me, now we're coming home
I hear them calling me, I hear them whispering
I hear them calling me, I hear them whispering
They're singing: &#8220;Now we are coming home&#8221;
(I hear them calling me, I hear them howling)
Singing: &#8220;Now we are coming home&#8221;
