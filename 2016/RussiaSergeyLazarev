We can never let the word be unspoken
We will never let our loving go, come undone
Everything we had is staying unbroken, oh
You will always be the only one
​You're the only one
Won't ever give up 'cause you're ​still somewhere out there
Nothing or no one's gonna keep us apart
​Breaking it down but I'm still getting nowhere
​Won't stop, hold on
​Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting
​Lights up the skyline to show where you are
​My love is rising, the story's unwinding
​Together we'll make it and reach for the stars
​You're the only one, you're my only one
​You're my life, every breath that I take
​Unforgettable, so unbelievable
​You're the only one, my only one
​I could have told you to slow down and stay down
​I could have told you a secret, won't you keep it now?
​Thinking of making a showdown when love is found
​Thinking of waiting till you're around
​
​​Won't ever give up 'cause you're ​still somewhere out there
Nothing or no one's gonna keep us apart
​Breaking it down but I'm still getting nowhere
​Won't stop, hold on
​Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting
​Lights up the skyline to show where you are
​My love is rising, the story's unwinding
​Together we'll make it and reach for the stars
​You're the only one, you're my only one
​You're my life, every breath that I take
​Unforgettable, so unbelievable
​You're the only one, my only one
You're my only one
​Thunder! (And lightning)
(It's getting exciting) It's getting exciting!
(​Lights up the skyline to show where you are)
To show where you are!
(​You're the only one) You're my only one
​You're my life, every breath that I take
​Unforgettable, so unbelievable
​You're the only one, my only one
