<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>When strangers are coming
They come to your house
They kill you all and say
We're not guilty, not guilty</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Where is your mind? Humanity cries
You think you are gods but everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls</em></font>
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>We could build a future
Where people are free
To live and love
The happiest time, our time</em></font>
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Where is your heart? Humanity rise
You think you are gods but everyone dies
Don't swallow my soul
Our souls</em></font>
I couldn't spend my youth there, ooh
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there, oh, oh
Because you took away my peace
I couldn't spend my youth there
I couldn't enjoy my motherland
