<p>Energy, oh what you do to me<br />
Your rhythm runs right through me, you&#8217;re my destiny<br />
My whole life is one big fantasy<br />
And yet the closer that I get, you&#8217;re further away</p>
<p>Energy, I feel such energy<br />
Electric runs right through me, I&#8217;m in ecstasy<br />
Your caress, the sweetness on your lips<br />
But the closer that I get, you&#8217;re drifting away</p>
<p>With every heartbeat, I&#8217;m electrified<br />
With just one look your body moves me, moves me<br />
If for one second you&#8217;d remember me<br />
Then I would break free<br />
From these chains that are wrapped around me</p>
<p>Energy, I feel such energy<br />
Your rhythm runs right through me, I&#8217;m in ecstasy<br />
Your caress, the sweetness on your lips<br />
But the closer that I get, you&#8217;re drifting away</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; energy, I feel such energy<br />
Electric runs right through me, you&#8217;re my destiny, oh&#8230;<br />
My whole life is one big fantasy, oh&#8230;<br />
And all I am means nothing till you&#8217;re here with me</p>
<p>Energy</p>
