<p>If it seems like the entire way was in vain<br />
If it seems like my heart is torn now<br />
There is a kind of song that rises in me and sings<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>If it pains you, your two eyes are in tears<br />
If it pains you and there&#8217;s no sign for what&#8217;s to come<br />
I will sing to you, caress your head up to your neck<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>Because this song consoles hearts<br />
Doesn&#8217;t give up, it always finds ways<br />
Turns bad into good time and again<br />
And the familiar melody returns<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>In front of a wave of joy, the sea of sorrow is large<br />
Light and darkness are fighting over us now<br />
Only the song is still rising, beloved and familiar<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>Because this song consoles hearts<br />
Doesn&#8217;t give up, it always finds ways<br />
Turns bad into good time and again<br />
And the familiar melody returns<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>Lalalala&#8230; lalalala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalalala&#8230; lalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Because this song consoles hearts<br />
Doesn&#8217;t give up, it always finds ways<br />
Turns bad into good time and again<br />
And the familiar melody returns<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>And the familiar melody returns<br />
Never mind, never mind, never mind</p>
<p>(Lalalala&#8230; lalalala lala&#8230;)<br />
You&#8217;ll see, sweetheart, never mind<br />
