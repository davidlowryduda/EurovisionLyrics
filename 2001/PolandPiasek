(How long will you wait for me?)</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get too close, you won&#8217;t see the joke<br />
Maybe everything looks so cool, maybe I&#8217;m just foolin&#8217;<br />
When I&#8217;m almost out the door, you&#8217;re still smilin&#8217; so<br />
Hey, I am thinking just the same, better if you think again</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a faker, yeah, someone who didn&#8217;t care<br />
And I would never want to be with someone like me<br />
But maybe one more night could make us feel all right<br />
What difference does it make? Tell me</p>
<p>(How long will I wait for you?) Too long for you<br />
(How long will you wait for me?) Oh&#8230; too long for me<br />
(How long is too long, yeah?) Too long, yeah<br />
We&#8217;ve been wastin&#8217; so much time<br />
Life&#8217;s too short – it would be a crime</p>
<p>So who&#8217;s behind the mask? Oh&#8230; you don&#8217;t have to ask<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you all there is about me, my cards are on the table<br />
And I have really learnt to hide these feelings deep inside<br />
I know the honesty within is nothing when you&#8217;re cryin&#8217;</p>
