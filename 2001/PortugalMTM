Yeah&#8230; whoa yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I still remember, but right now I don&#8217;t know<br />
If it was to you that I told my secret<br />
I walk without direction, I search for your sea<br />
It&#8217;s your island that I want to find</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in your kiss that I find the charm<br />
In your hug I find the heat that I need<br />
In your glance, an insolent desire<br />
With your love, everything makes sense</p>
<p>Oh, I only can be happy this way<br />
Like your kiss holding onto me<br />
Oh, I only can be happy this way<br />
Mad, insane about you till the end</p>
<p>Beyond the reason, the magic is born<br />
Cristals of illusion, you are my fantasy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in your kiss that I find the charm<br />
In your hug I find the heat that I need<br />
In your glance, an insolent desire<br />
With your love, everything makes sense</p>
<p>Oh, I only can be happy this way<br />
Like your kiss holding onto me<br />
Oh, I only can be happy this way<br />
Mad, insane about you till the end</p>
<p>Oh, I only can be happy this way<br />
Like your kiss holding onto me<br />
Oh, I only can be happy this way<br />
Mad, insane about you till the end</p>
<p>Oh, I only can be happy this way (Oh, I only can)<br />
Like your kiss holding onto me (Like your kiss)<br />
Oh, I only can be happy this way (Oh, I only can)<br />
Mad, insane about you till the end<br />
