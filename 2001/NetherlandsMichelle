<p>Closing the door, leaving behind all that has been<br />
No turn around, life begins out on my own</p>
<p>Follow the sun from day to day, free as a bird<br />
Now is the time to spread my wings out on my own</p>
<p>Come to the conclusion I am in control<br />
Take it with my body and my soul</p>
<p>I can fly over mountains, over seas<br />
I never felt so free in the choices of my life<br />
I can fly over mountains, over seas<br />
I never felt so free in the choices of my life</p>
<p>Closing the door, leaving behind all that has been<br />
Now is the time to spread my wings out on my own</p>
<p>Come to the conclusion I am in control<br />
Take it with my body and my soul</p>
<p>I can fly over mountains, over seas<br />
I never felt so free in the choices of my life<br />
I can fly over mountains, over seas<br />
I never felt so free in the choices of my life</p>
<p>Free in the choices of my life<br />
Free in the choices of my life</p>
