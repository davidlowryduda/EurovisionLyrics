<p>I wanna know what you feel inside<br />
Is something wrong? Why did you leave last night?<br />
Is it all just a game?<br />
Oh, tell me why we can&#8217;t be lovers</p>
<p>I do believe in the two of us<br />
That you and me, we are the only ones<br />
And we were meant to be true<br />
So tell me why we can&#8217;t be lovers</p>
<p>How could I be such a fool<br />
I thought I already knew it all<br />
But I know I was totally wrong</p>
<p>Listen to your heartbeat, it will take you higher<br />
Follow your emotions, I know you&#8217;ll get stronger<br />
Listen to your heartbeat, the feeling will guide you<br />
Hold on to devotion, I know it&#8217;s inside you</p>
<p>How will I know if you&#8217;re fooling me?<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m wrong, but it seems to be<br />
Like it&#8217;s all just a game<br />
And I just want us to be lovers</p>
<p>We had it all in our hands<br />
Just like those all happy ends<br />
I still don&#8217;t know why, but we lost it somehow</p>
<p>Listen to your heartbeat, it will take you higher<br />
Follow your emotions, I know you&#8217;ll get stronger<br />
Listen to your heartbeat, the feeling will guide you<br />
Hold on to devotion, I know it&#8217;s inside you</p>
<p>One more chance to make a try<br />
Nothing left to do for you and I</p>
<p>Listen to your heartbeat, it will take you higher<br />
Follow your emotions, I know you&#8217;ll get stronger<br />
Listen to your heartbeat, the feeling will guide you<br />
Hold on to devotion, I know it&#8217;s inside you</p>
<p>Listen to your heartbeat</p>
