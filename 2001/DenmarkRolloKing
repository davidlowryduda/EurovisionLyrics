<p>Oh&#8230; oh&#8230; mmm&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ll never ever let you go<br />
Mmm&#8230; mmm&#8230; mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Each morning I wake up alone<br />
For too long I&#8217;ve been on my own<br />
You seem to fill my heart and mind<br />
The greatest love that I could find<br />
Love that I could find</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings<br />
You bring back memories all the time<br />
I&#8217;ll never ever be the same since you left me lonely<br />
So please come back to me again</p>
<p>These last days I&#8217;ve been down and blue<br />
I wonder if you miss me too<br />
I think about you all the time<br />
And keep on waitin&#8217; for a sign<br />
Waitin&#8217; for a sign</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings<br />
You bring back memories all the time<br />
I&#8217;ll never ever be the same since you left me lonely<br />
So please come back to me again</p>
<p>I cry out your name<br />
I&#8217;m sick and tired of this game<br />
Ooh, baby, kiss me<br />
I think this love was meant to be<br />
Oh yeah, oh, love was meant to be, yeah</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings<br />
You bring back memories all the time<br />
I&#8217;ll never ever be the same since you left me lonely<br />
So please come back to me again</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ll never ever let you go<br />
Mmm&#8230; oh&#8230; yeah</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never ever let you go though you hurt my feelings<br />
You bring back memories all the time<br />
I&#8217;ll never ever be the same since you left me lonely<br />
So please come back to me again</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never ever let you go</p>
