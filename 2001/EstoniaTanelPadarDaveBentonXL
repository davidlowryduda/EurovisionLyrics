<p>All right &#8211; Hey hey<br />
Well, are you ready? &#8211; You bet<br />
But are you ready? &#8211; Oh yeah<br />
All right &#8211; You give it to them now</p>
<p>Well, every night&#8217;s a Friday night &#8211; Aha, what night?<br />
Ladies, this sure feels right &#8211; I guess this is party time<br />
The two of us will sing again &#8211; Two of us together again<br />
The heart is young and we know when &#8211; Young and handsome, they say<br />
Come on, Dave</p>
<p>To kick the sadness out the door &#8211; To kick the sadness out the door<br />
And roll the carpet from the floor &#8211; Haha, carpet from the floor, yeah<br />
Let the spirit hit the roof &#8211; I hit the roof, I hit the roof<br />
The two of us still know the moves</p>
<p>And not even time can take away<br />
The starlight from us, no, it won&#8217;t fade<br />
Still we believe that we<br />
Were made to laugh and sing</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s sing along<br />
And feel the power of a song<br />
Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s feel the spark<br />
That always stays within our hearts</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, and let it out<br />
And live the moment, here and now<br />
Come on, everybody, &#8217;cause here&#8217;s a chance<br />
To feel so light, to laugh and dance</p>
<p>A little rollercoaster ride &#8211; He&#8217;s goin&#8217; for a ride now<br />
Right into the starry night &#8211; Around and around and around we go<br />
And leave the windows open wide &#8211; Why nobody can&#8217;t stay?<br />
And let the music pour inside &#8211; Aha</p>
<p>Not even time can take away<br />
The starlight from us, no, it won&#8217;t fade<br />
Still we believe that we<br />
Were made to laugh and sing</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s sing along<br />
And feel the power of a song<br />
Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s feel the spark<br />
That always stays within our hearts</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, and let it out<br />
And live the moment, here and now<br />
Come on, everybody, &#8217;cause here&#8217;s a chance<br />
To feel so light, to laugh and dance</p>
<p>Look at us now here together again<br />
We started out long time ago &#8211; We knew back then<br />
The music within us could never, could never end<br />
All right</p>
<p>Oh yeah&#8230; &#8211; Let&#8217;s sing along<br />
Y&#8217;all come on &#8211; Come on, everybody<br />
Come on, come on &#8211; Na na na na yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Come on, come on &#8211; One more time, yeah</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s sing along<br />
And feel the power of a song<br />
Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s feel the spark<br />
That always stays within our hearts</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, and let it out<br />
And live the moment, here and now<br />
Come on, everybody, &#8217;cause here&#8217;s a chance<br />
To feel so light, to laugh and dance</p>
<p>Come on, everybody, let&#8217;s sing along</p>
