<p>The golden sand beneath my feet, there&#8217;s music in the air<br />
A guitar in my hand, I&#8217;m sure you understand all this is magic<br />
No matter where the wind blows I&#8217;ll always think of you<br />
Stay with me, young and free, we&#8217;ll live in perfect harmony</p>
<p>Another summer night down by the ocean<br />
Under the palm trees, you and I<br />
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight<br />
Just like a dream that never dies<br />
Never dies, never dies</p>
<p>Blue skies all around us feels like love is everywhere<br />
Just a smile and our eyes will meet so we can feel the fire burning<br />
A taste of heaven&#8217;s what I need, can never get enough<br />
Million stars, endless sky, with each moment passing by</p>
<p>Another summer night down by the ocean (By the ocean)<br />
Under the palm trees, you and I (Just you and I)<br />
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight<br />
Just like a dream that never dies<br />
Never dies, never dies (Like a dream that never dies)</p>
<p>Another summer night down by the ocean (By the ocean)<br />
Under the palm trees, you and I (You and I)<br />
Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight<br />
Just like a dream that never dies<br />
Never dies</p>
<p>(Another summer night down by the ocean, just by the ocean)<br />
(Under the palm trees, you and I) Never dies<br />
(Walking on the beach beneath the moonlight)<br />
(Just like a dream that never dies)<br />
Another summer night</p>
