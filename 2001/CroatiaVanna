<p>Aha&#8230; aha&#8230;<br />
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t break my heart tonight, don&#8217;t leave me when I cry<br />
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart<br />
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right<br />
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart<br />
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t break my heart tonight, don&#8217;t leave me when I cry<br />
Stay now and softly play the strings of my heart<br />
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right<br />
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t break my heart, oh no<br />
(Don&#8217;t break my heart, don&#8217;t break my heart, don&#8217;t break my heart)<br />
I want you by my side, you make me feel all right<br />
(Right by my side, right by my side, I feel all right)<br />
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart</p>
<p>(Strings of my heart)<br />
And let the fiddler play on the strings of my heart</p>
