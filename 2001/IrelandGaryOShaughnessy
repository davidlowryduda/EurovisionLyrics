<p>I don&#8217;t want to live my life without you<br />
I don&#8217;t ever want to say goodbye<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re the only one that I am here for<br />
Never want to see you cry</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t go on (Can&#8217;t go on)<br />
Oh no<br />
No, I can&#8217;t go on (I can&#8217;t go on)<br />
Oh no</p>
<p>Without your love, without your heart<br />
I&#8217;d be lost here, in the dark<br />
I just don&#8217;t know<br />
Where would I be without your love?<br />
You&#8217;re the light in the dark</p>
<p>I want to wake up with you beside me<br />
I will never let this feeling die<br />
I just want to be here in the morning<br />
To see the sunlight in your eyes</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t go on (Can&#8217;t go on)<br />
Oh no<br />
No, I can&#8217;t go on (I can&#8217;t go on)<br />
Oh no</p>
<p>Without your love, without your heart<br />
I&#8217;d be lost here, in the dark<br />
I just don&#8217;t know<br />
Where would I be without your love?</p>
<p>Without your love, without your heart<br />
I&#8217;d be lost here, in the dark<br />
I just don&#8217;t know<br />
Where would I be without your love?<br />
You&#8217;re the light in the dark</p>
