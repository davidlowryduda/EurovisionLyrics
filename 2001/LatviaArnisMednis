<p>The day before marriage I was out so long in the night<br />
My lovely fiancée no more has been on my sight<br />
Why do I feel this way? Don´t know, last night was great<br />
But something&#8217;s screwin&#8217; me up, I swear to God I will stop</p>
<p>Too much, too much, too much I say<br />
My life, it looks like cabaret<br />
Too much, too much, too much, enough<br />
I swear I&#8217;ll never use that stuff</p>
<p>Oh, baby, take me back (Okay)<br />
Oh, give me one more smile (All right)<br />
You&#8217;re mine and only one (We&#8217;ll see)<br />
Why, darling, you don&#8217;t come?</p>
<p>The day after marriage I went in the streets with my bride<br />
She wants a cup of tea. Oh no, I&#8217;m voting for beer<br />
You see how good is she &#8211; my caring, lonely fiancée<br />
We walked again the bar through light (Through light)<br />
Oh God, there&#8217;s girls from last night</p>
<p>Too much, too much, too much I say<br />
My life, it looks like cabaret<br />
Too much, too much, too much, enough<br />
I swear I&#8217;ll never use that stuff</p>
<p>Oh, baby, take me back (Okay)<br />
Oh, give me one more smile (All right)<br />
You&#8217;re mine and only one (We&#8217;ll see)<br />
Why, darling, you don&#8217;t come?</p>
<p>Oh, baby, take me back<br />
Please, baby, take me back<br />
Give me, give me one more chance, give me one more chance<br />
Come on, baby, one more chance, give me one more chance</p>
<p>Too much, too much, too much I say<br />
My life, it looks like cabaret<br />
Too much, too much, too much, enough<br />
I swear I&#8217;ll never use that stuff</p>
<p>Oh, baby, take me back (Okay)<br />
Oh, give me one more smile (All right)<br />
You&#8217;re mine and only one (We&#8217;ll see)<br />
Why, darling, you don&#8217;t come?</p>
<p>Oh, baby, take me back (Okay)<br />
Oh, give me one more smile (All right)<br />
You&#8217;re mine and only one (We&#8217;ll see)<br />
Why, darling, you don&#8217;t come?</p>
