If you see her, ask her what she feels<br />
If still something remains of that love that united us<br />
If you find her quite indifferent<br />
Make her see reason, and do me this favour</p>
<p>Talk to her, insist on her that they&#8217;ve done us damage<br />
That everything is a lie</p>
<p>Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m going crazy because of this nonsense<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m sailing between love and fear<br />
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me</p>
<p>(Tell her) That I love her<br />
(Tell her) That I&#8217;m sincere<br />
(Tell her) Tell her that this melancholy is killing me</p>
<p>If you see her, remind her that she has<br />
The doors of my heart wide open<br />
Tell her that my tears don&#8217;t understand<br />
Why she isn&#8217;t with me in this room</p>
<p>Talk to her, insist on her that that they&#8217;ve done us damage<br />
That everything is a lie</p>
<p>Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m going crazy because of this nonsense<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m sailing between love and fear<br />
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me</p>
<p>(Tell her, tell her, tell her) Tell her that I&#8217;m going crazy<br />
(Tell her, tell her, tell her)</p>
<p>Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m going crazy because of this nonsense<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m sailing between love and fear<br />
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me</p>
<p>Tell her that I love her, that I was always sincere<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m going crazy because of this nonsense<br />
Tell her that I&#8217;m sailing between love and fear<br />
Tell her that this melancholy is killing me</p>
<p>Tell her<br />
