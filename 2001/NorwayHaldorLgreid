<p>In tender years, the path seemed longer then it ever really was<br />
How could I know?<br />
I realised, as time went by, I had to try, the world outside was mine<br />
You let me go</p>
<p>So I left and tried to find my way to paradise<br />
The winding road that lead me there was life</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on my own again<br />
Left all alone, where I belong<br />
I&#8217;m on my own again<br />
Left all alone</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;ve seen it all, I wouldn&#8217;t change a day â€“ when curtains fall<br />
I do my show</p>
<p>So at last I know I&#8217;ve found my one true paradise<br />
The winding road that lead me there was life</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on my own again<br />
Left all alone, where I belong<br />
I&#8217;m on my own again<br />
I&#8217;m on my own, on my own</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m on my own again)<br />
(Left all alone, where I belong)<br />
(I&#8217;m on my own again) On my own<br />
(Left all alone) On my own, on my own again</p>
