Summer sunshine falling into your room<br />
Bright and warm, embracing you<br />
And the dark view, which clouds your days<br />
Suddenly becomes clear again</p>
<p>Ice turns to fire, when its magic quietly touches you<br />
And all of a sudden your grey day starts to shine<br />
And you hear the melody, full of emotion and full of poetry</p>
<p>Those who experience love, will be immortal<br />
Those who experience love, won&#8217;t ever be alone<br />
Look for love with every new day</p>
<p>Sometimes it smiles at you<br />
And will stay with you your whole life long<br />
Mmm&#8230; sometimes all your happiness lies in just one moment<br />
And you look for the melody, full of emotion and full of poetry</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
