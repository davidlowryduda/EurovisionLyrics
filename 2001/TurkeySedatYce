<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
In my every song, every word<br />
In any night of mine without you<br />
You were there, you again<br />
My heart trembles because you&#8217;re not here</p>
<p>On the long endless roads<br />
In the rain, in my tears<br />
You were there, you again<br />
My heart trembles because you&#8217;re not here</p>
<p>For the last time look behind<br />
What&#8217;s left except your sorrow<br />
Please look behind to see what you&#8217;ve left<br />
While my arms are waiting for you, my love is on the roads</p>
<p>It is going mad, whoa&#8230;<br />
Ah, this heart of mine beats always with the pain you brought to me<br />
The one that carries you in it like crazy</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>So far away, so far apart<br />
Lonely am I, my love, tonight<br />
Longing for all I left behind<br />
Precious moments I no longer find</p>
<p>Love has gone, memories &#8211; they fade away<br />
Nothing more left for me but only to say<br />
I still love you, please come back, my lonely heart<br />
Keeps calling you back once again<br />
I feel that old pain, lonely am I now tonight</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;</em></font><br />
