<p>No dream impossible<br />
No dream impossible</p>
<p>No dream, no dream<br />
(Be strong, on and on)<br />
(Keep pushing, on and on)<br />
(Be strong, on and on)<br />
(Keep pushing, holding on)</p>
<p>We look for the highest<br />
We follow the straightest road<br />
We danced with the angels<br />
Where heaven touches the end of the world</p>
<p>We look to the future<br />
We reach for eternity<br />
There in the distance<br />
Everything was so clear to me</p>
<p>If we keep holding on<br />
Have faith in ourselves<br />
Be strong, be free</p>
<p>No dream impossible<br />
No dream impossible<br />
As long as you&#8217;re living with hope in your heart</p>
<p>In dreams we&#8217;re untouchable<br />
Forever invincible<br />
If you believe with love in your heart<br />
There&#8217;s no dream impossible</p>
<p>(Hey you, have you got a dream?)<br />
(When you wake in the day)<br />
(Is it as bad as it seemed in the night?)<br />
Have you got a dream in ya heart?</p>
<p>(When you&#8217;re fighting for your life) Hold on<br />
(Lotta strife) Ooh yeah<br />
(Don&#8217;t give up, when things gettin&#8217; tough)<br />
(The city is a jungle and the strong survive)<br />
Gotta be strong, keep holding on</p>
<p>(Keep on, holding on) Keep strong<br />
(Keep pushing, on and on) You&#8217;re alive<br />
(Keep on, holding on)<br />
You&#8217;re alive&#8230;</p>
<p>No dream impossible<br />
No dream impossible<br />
As long as you&#8217;re livin&#8217; with hope in your heart<br />
(You&#8217;ve got to have hope in your heart)</p>
<p>In dreams we&#8217;re untouchable<br />
(In dreams we&#8217;re untouchable)<br />
Forever invincible<br />
If you believe with love in your heart<br />
There&#8217;s no dream impossible</p>
<p>(Keep on, holding on)<br />
(Keep pushing, on and on)<br />
There&#8217;s no dream impossible</p>
