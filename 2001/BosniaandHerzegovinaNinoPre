<p>Even if the sun came out promptly at half past two<br />
Even if from a clear sky thunderbolt struck me<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t care, you wouldn&#8217;t wink<br />
Much less when I call you, turn you head</p>
<p>Even if the snow fell now on the tree blooms and fruits<br />
Even if I told you to your face what I want<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t care, you wouldn&#8217;t wink<br />
Much less for my pleasure, at least smile</p>
<p>Hana, come on, don&#8217;t your eyes see?<br />
Doesn&#8217;t your soul hear when I say I love you?<br />
Hana, come on, don&#8217;t your eyes see?<br />
Doesn&#8217;t your soul hear when I say I love you?</p>
<p>Aha&#8230; aha&#8230; aha&#8230; aha&#8230;</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>A thousand times I&#8217;ve tried to walk away<br />
I&#8217;m losin&#8217; my mind about you &#8211; what can I say?<br />
You keep telling me to let you go, that makes me wanna cry<br />
&#8216;Cause God knows I love you so, so much, I&#8217;m gonna die</em></font></p>
<p>Hana, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>come, come on, tell me what is going on<br />
Tell me, would it be all right for me to be your light?</em></font><br />

Tell me, would it be all right for me to be your&#8230;?</em></font></p>
