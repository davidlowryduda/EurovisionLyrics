<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Since we have to tell, since we have to talk about ourselves<br />
Since your heart doesn&#8217;t burn anymore like before<br />
Even if love, I believe, isn&#8217;t said anymore<br />
But since we have to tell, then listen to me</p>
<p>But I only have my soul to talk to you about myself<br />
Oh, only my soul, my soul and my voice<br />
So fragile flames at my finger tips<br />
Derisory arms to talk about myself</p>
<p>Even if you say that I&#8217;m part of you<br />
That our history will follow us step by step<br />
I know very well that love has its laws<br />
If we are to save it, then listen to me</p>
<p>But I only have my soul to talk to you about myself<br />
Oh, only my soul, my soul and my voice<br />
And my body is on fire because of the sound of your voice<br />
I&#8217;m only a woman who likes you silently</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
