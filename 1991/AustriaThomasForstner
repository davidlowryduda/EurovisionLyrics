Lights in the rain, I&#8217;ve seen you<br />
A smile like soft magic<br />
Enchanted, frozen, completely lost in you<br />
Feelings as deep as the night</p>
<p>Silent realization, and longing for more<br />
Tender eyes, I want to belong to you</p>
<p>Venice in the rain<br />
Let us this night simply dream (Dream)<br />
Venice in the rain<br />
To the end of the night simply dream</p>
<p>Your light breath, buried in my shoulder<br />
Your magic deep down in me<br />
Felt, sensed, carried away from you<br />
To be by you and yet not here</p>
<p>Silent realization, and longing for more<br />
Tender eyes, I want to belong to you</p>
<p>Venice in the rain<br />
Let us this night simply dream  (Dream)<br />
Venice in the rain<br />
To the end of the night simply dream</p>
<p>Venice in the rain<br />
(Let us this night) Simply dream (Dream)<br />
Venice in the rain<br />
To the end of the night simply dream</p>
<p>Venice in the rain<br />
(Let us this night) Simply dream<br />
Dream<br />
