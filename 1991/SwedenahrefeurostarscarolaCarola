I have never stopped believing<br />
That after every night waits the dawn<br />
Even though I can&#8217;t understand<br />
There&#8217;s time for laughter when I start all over again</p>
<p>I can smell the scent from a quiet ocean<br />
Suddenly I&#8217;m in the middle of a vivid hurricane</p>
<p>I am captured by a stormwind, stuck on you<br />
Nothing can stop me, when it&#8217;s blowing in my heart<br />
Captured by a stormwind night and day<br />
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind</p>
<p>It is time to move on<br />
For the moments that have passed, never come back<br />
Travelling on an open sea<br />
Where everything is like new in the future you give</p>
<p>I&#8217;m leaving my safe harbour without missing it<br />
Free, but still tied to open arms</p>
<p>I am captured by a stormwind, stuck on you<br />
Nothing can stop me, when it&#8217;s blowing in my heart<br />
Captured by a stormwind night and day<br />
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind</p>
<p>We are walking together, united by the bonds of love<br />
My longing is awakened, when you smile and give me your hand</p>
<p>I am captured by a stormwind<br />
Captured by a stormwind (stuck on you)<br />
Nothing can stop me, when it&#8217;s blowing in my heart<br />
Captured by a stormwind night and day<br />
Only you and I are here, and the light that heaven left behind</p>
<p>(Captured by a stormwind)<br />
I am captured by a stormwind<br />
