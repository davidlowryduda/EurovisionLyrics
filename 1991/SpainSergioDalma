<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
To dance from afar is not dancing<br />
It&#8217;s like dancing alone<br />
You&#8217;re dancing in your volcano<br />
And two meters from you<br />
I&#8217;m dancing on the pole</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s try only once<br />
To dance closely as with fire<br />
Embracing the beat<br />
Without ever separating<br />
Your body from my body</p>
<p>To dance closely is dancing<br />
Like the sea dances with the dolphins<br />
Heart to heart in just one ballroom<br />
Two dancers</p>
<p>Both embracing each other<br />
Caressing each other, feeling each other&#8217;s skin<br />
Our ballad is going to be played<br />
Let&#8217;s try, try the art of flying</p>
<p>To dance closely is dancing<br />
To dance closely is dancing<br />
Is dancing<br />
