Love, sun, sea, moon and stars<br />
Beautiful words, they&#8217;re beautiful words<br />
Sweeter than those nobody has ever written<br />
They&#8217;re just words, words but</p>
<p>Only the one who never falls in love<br />
Doesn&#8217;t have a heart to sing</p>
<p>But how sweet the sea is<br />
How sweet you are<br />
When love is young<br />
You feel like singing</p>
<p>But how beautiful the sun is<br />
When you stand by me<br />
When I call you butterfly<br />
Fly and I&#8217;ll fly with you</p>
<p>And round, round, the world goes<br />
Round among the stars and I can&#8217;t stop<br />
And you sing, sing a song<br />
That nobody can hear, that nobody knows</p>
<p>It has always been like this, and it&#8217;ll always be the same<br />
Love is what makes us live</p>
<p>Love, sun, sea, moon and stars<br />
Are always nice to sing about</p>
<p>But how sweet the sea is<br />
How sweet you are<br />
When love is young<br />
You feel like singing</p>
<p>But how sweet the sun is<br />
When you stand by me<br />
When I call you butterfly<br />
Fly and I&#8217;ll fly with you</p>
<p>When I call you butterfly<br />
Fly and I&#8217;ll fly for you<br />
