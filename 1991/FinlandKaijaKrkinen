I didn&#8217;t even want to own you<br />
I didn&#8217;t even want to love you<br />
We two travellers came across each other<br />
Shared one common moment together</p>
<p>I was left behind when the morning took you away<br />
My heart won&#8217;t give me peace<br />
I can&#8217;t let go, I need you<br />
But I&#8217;m hoping in vain for you to be next to me</p>
<p>One crazy night, the wild heart is beating<br />
I suppose we had time to give each other something<br />
One crazy night, the wild heart is beating<br />
We didn&#8217;t even want to bear the responsibility</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find you in my arms anymore<br />
I&#8217;m touching you only in my sleep<br />
In my sleep</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even want to own you<br />
I didn&#8217;t even want to love you<br />
Just one night is so easy to forget<br />
But the hungry heart cannot find any peace</p>
<p>One crazy night, the wild heart is beating<br />
I suppose we had time to give each other something<br />
One crazy night, the wild heart is beating<br />
We didn&#8217;t even want to bear the responsibility</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find you in my arms anymore<br />
I&#8217;m touching you only in my sleep</p>
<p>One crazy night, the wild heart is beating<br />
I suppose we had time to give each other something<br />
One crazy night, the wild heart is beating<br />
We didn&#8217;t even want to bear the responsibility</p>
<p>One crazy night, hey&#8230;<br />
(One crazy night, the wild heart is beating)<br />
(I suppose we had time to give each other something)</p>
<p>One crazy night, ha&#8230;<br />
(One crazy night, the wild heart is beating)<br />
(We didn&#8217;t even want to bear the responsibility)<br />
One crazy night<br />
