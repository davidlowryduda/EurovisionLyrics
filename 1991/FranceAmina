It&#8217;s the last one who spoke who is right in my house<br />
It&#8217;s who gave me a name that is right in any case<br />
Girl or boy, all those sayings are lessons, don&#8217;t say<br />
The world is neither bad nor good, you don&#8217;t turn around, it&#8217;s without reason</p>
<p>Huah huah&#8230; huah huah&#8230;<br />
Hiah hiah&#8230; hiah hiah hiah&#8230;<br />
Huah&#8230; hiah&#8230;</p>
<p>Tell me for what country you speak louder in my house<br />
Don&#8217;t scream out like a violin without a music score, it&#8217;s a lesson<br />
The truth is hiding its face like a silence that says a lot<br />
It&#8217;s the loudest who spoke who is right in any case</p>
<p>Huah huah&#8230; huah huah&#8230;<br />
Hiah hiah&#8230; hiah hiah hiah&#8230;<br />
Huah&#8230; hiah&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the last one who spoke who is right in my house<br />
It&#8217;s the last one who spoke who is right in any case<br />
All the seasons do and undo even passions, what a mockery<br />
It&#8217;s the last one who spoke who is right without any condition</p>
<p>Like this or like that<br />
Here or over there</p>
<p>Huah huah&#8230; huah huah&#8230;<br />
Hiah hiah&#8230; hiah hiah hiah&#8230;<br />
Huah&#8230; hiah&#8230;</p>
<p>Hiah hiah&#8230; hiah hiah hiah&#8230;<br />
Huah&#8230;<br />
