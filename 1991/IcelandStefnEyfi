Now you are beside me, Nina<br />
Caressing my cheek, Nina<br />
Oh, hold my hand, Nina</p>
<p>For you know that I will never again<br />
I will never, never again<br />
Never again share a moment with you</p>
<p>It hurts to miss someone<br />
Life goes on, but for what reason?<br />
I do not want to wake up from you</p>
<p>Because I know that you will never ever<br />
You will never, never ever<br />
Never ever caress my cheek</p>
<p>When you appear in my dreams everything is sweet and good<br />
I wish I could sleep for a century<br />
Because the night only offers a moment with you</p>
<p>When I wake up<br />
Nina, you are no longer here<br />
My eyes open<br />
But there&#8217;s no one to caress my cheek</p>
<p>A day is like an eternity, without you<br />
The night is cold and empty, without you<br />
When the night comes I go to you</p>
<p>When you appear in my dreams everything is sweet and good<br />
I wish I could sleep for a century<br />
Because the night only offers a moment with you</p>
<p>When I wake up<br />
Nina, you are no longer here<br />
My eyes open<br />
But there&#8217;s no one to caress my cheek</p>
<p>When I wake up, oh<br />
Nina, you are no longer here<br />
My eyes open<br />
But there&#8217;s no one to caress my cheek<br />
