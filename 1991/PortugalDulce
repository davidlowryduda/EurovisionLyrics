Fado, crying the sadness a lot<br />
Fado, falling asleep with the pain<br />
Mmm&#8230; fado, just when the longing comes<br />
Pulling a great love back from my past</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t condemn that passion<br />
That sorrow in the words<br />
The guitar is also crying</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t ask for forgiveness<br />
When I enjoy sinning<br />
And become myself once again</p>
<p>Because I want to be happy<br />
And the misfortune is silent<br />
I don&#8217;t want what fado is all about</p>
<p>Fado, sobbing memories<br />
Fado, reviving the pain<br />
Fado, only when the longing comes<br />
Pulling a great love back from my past</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t condemn that passion<br />
That sorrow in the words<br />
The guitar is also crying</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t ask for forgiveness<br />
When I enjoy sinning<br />
And become myself once again</p>
<p>I know that side we have<br />
Filled with Lusitanian soul<br />
As in the legend of Severa</p>
<p>Because I want to be happy<br />
And misfortune is silent<br />
Fado doesn&#8217;t make me regret<br />
