<p>Shadows fall, it&#8217;s so lonely waiting here<br />
There&#8217;s a garden bare out there, where songbirds sing no more<br />
No golden stardust shining and no lining on the cloud<br />
Could it be you and me have found our rainbow&#8217;s end?</p>
<p>Autumn leaves falling softly all around<br />
There ain&#8217;t but a single sound of voices I once knew<br />
No silver star to follow and no moon to light the way<br />
Could it be you and me are playing &#8216;let&#8217;s pretend&#8217;?</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t you just call me?<br />
If I&#8217;m to blame at all, I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m sorry<br />
It&#8217;s useless standing tall, I&#8217;m longing for your touch<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for a love I knew so well, so well</p>
<p>Winter cold, and the wind blows through my hair<br />
Deep inside you know I care, no matter what&#8217;s in store<br />
Our lines of love ain&#8217;t rhyming and the rhythm is all gone<br />
Could it be you and me can&#8217;t say we&#8217;re on the mend?<br />
Let&#8217;s pretend</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t you just call me?<br />
If I&#8217;m to blame at all, I&#8217;ll say I&#8217;m sorry<br />
It&#8217;s useless standing tall, I&#8217;m longing for your touch<br />
I&#8217;m waiting for a love I knew so well, ooh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Whoa whoa&#8230; won&#8217;t you just call me?<br />
That&#8217;s all I need to hear to ease the worry<br />
I&#8217;ll kiss each lonely tear, to me you mean so much<br />
God knows I speak the truth and time will tell</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230;</p>
