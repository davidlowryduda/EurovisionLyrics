Like a dream, you were flying around inside me<br />
Sneaking into my mind<br />
Turned my reality upside down<br />
Caught my thoughts, laid with my self-confidence</p>
<p>Mmm, doubts and hopes and longings whizzing out and in<br />
Do you feel like I do? Then listen to me:</p>
<p>Meet me where the heart beats<br />
Where love happens<br />
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around</p>
<p>Take me further out than the light can reach<br />
Snd hold me for a thousand years<br />
Do you know that I&#8217;m waiting? Do you want to know where?<br />
Where the heart beats</p>
<p>This night you became reality<br />
Melted into my body<br />
Flew through the empty space<br />
Dizzy and intoxicated, I drank of your love</p>
<p>Mmm, the world has changed, are we going the same way?<br />
Oh, do you feel like I do? Then come with me</p>
<p>Meet me where the heart beats<br />
Where love happens<br />
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around</p>
<p>Take me further out than the light can reach<br />
And hold me for a thousand years<br />
Do you know that I&#8217;m waiting? Do you want to know where?<br />
Where the heart beats, oh&#8230;.</p>
<p>Where the heart beats<br />
Where love happens<br />
Where the world ends, where the thought is turning around</p>
<p>Oh, take me further out than the light can reach<br />
And hold me for a thousand years<br />
Do you know that I&#8217;m waiting? Do you want to know where?<br />
Where the heart beats</p>
<p>Where the heart beats<br />
