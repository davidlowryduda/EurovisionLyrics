<p>Half the world is hungry<br />
Just through being born<br />
And every day is a compromise<br />
For a grain of corn</p>
<p>And half the world have too much<br />
Their only hunger is their greed<br />
Through politics and ignorance<br />
Half the world&#8217;s in need</p>
<p>A message to your heart, it&#8217;s all right<br />
Say a little prayer and sleep tonight, oh&#8230;<br />
Tomorrow you&#8217;ll still be in paradise, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>A message to your heart, walk on by<br />
Till you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh&#8230;<br />
There but for the grace of God, go I</p>
<p>Half the world is lucky<br />
Born in paradise<br />
But they don&#8217;t see the children<br />
With hunger in their eyes</p>
<p>And the time has come for changes<br />
Though for some it&#8217;s much too late<br />
There&#8217;s got to be an answer<br />
The hungry cannot wait</p>
<p>A message to your heart, it&#8217;s all right<br />
Say a little prayer and sleep tonight, oh&#8230;<br />
Tomorrow you&#8217;ll still be in paradise, oh&#8230;</p>
<p>A message to your heart, walk on by<br />
Until you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh&#8230;<br />
There but for the grace of God, go I</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; a message to your heart, walk on by<br />
Till you hear the voice of conscience cry, oh&#8230;<br />
There but for the grace of God, go I</p>
<p>There but for the grace of God, go I<br />
(A message to your heart)</p>
