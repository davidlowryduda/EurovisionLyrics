How can we unite our horizons?<br />
Free are those who don&#8217;t know any sorrow<br />
Fear makes you mad, it calls for hate<br />
Evil grows in our minds</p>
<p>And yet love is the meaning of our life<br />
A stolen kiss in this injured world<br />
Can bring us hope</p>
<p>Saturated with images, the world is distrustful<br />
The paths to our hearts have barriers<br />
A lost life, a tree cut down<br />
Add my tears to the rivers</p>
<p>And yet love is the meaning of our life<br />
A stolen kiss in this injured world<br />
Can bring us hope</p>
<p>Our memories are filled by our dazzled eyes<br />
Happiness frees our emotions (Like a stolen kiss)<br />
Like a stolen kiss (Like a stolen kiss)</p>
<p>And yet love is the meaning of our life<br />
An invented story, a hope that is found back<br />
Creates a universe without suffering<br />
