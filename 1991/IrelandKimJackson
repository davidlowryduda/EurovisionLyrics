<p>I don&#8217;t know why I want you the way that I want you<br />
And I don&#8217;t know why I miss you the way that I miss you<br />
But when I&#8217;m in your arms it makes me feel so good<br />
And I don&#8217;t know the reason why<br />
I don&#8217;t know the reason why</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t understand why I feel the way I do<br />
And I don&#8217;t understand what I feel when I&#8217;m with you<br />
And anyway now, it&#8217;s no use worrying<br />
Until I find out what it is</p>
<p>Could it be that when I&#8217;m with you my fears all go away?<br />
Could it be that when I&#8217;m with you it&#8217;s like the start of a brand new day?<br />
Or is it just that when I hold you I can&#8217;t hold you enough?<br />
Or could it be that I&#8217;m in love?</p>
<p>Somebody once told me: &#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta trust your heart&#8221; (Gotta trust your heart)<br />
And this I have tried to do right from the very start<br />
And when I&#8217;m close to you it makes me feel so good<br />
And I don&#8217;t know the reason why</p>
<p>Could it be that when I&#8217;m with you my fears all go away?<br />
Could it be that when I&#8217;m with you it&#8217;s like the start of a brand new day?<br />
Or is it just that when I hold you I can&#8217;t hold you enough?<br />
Or could it be that I&#8217;m in love?</p>
<p>Could it be that I&#8217;m in love?<br />
Could it be that I&#8217;m in love?</p>
