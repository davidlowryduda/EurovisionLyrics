<p>Here is my home, here I was born<br />
On the plain by the sea<br />
Here are the friends I grew up with<br />
And I have no other place in the world<br />
I have no other place in the world</p>
<p>Here is my home, here I would play<br />
In the lowlands by the mountainside<br />
Here I drank water from the well<br />
And I planted grass in the desert<br />
And I planted grass in the desert</p>
<p>Here I was born, here my children were born<br />
Here I built my home with my own two hands<br />
Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends<br />
And after two thousand years, an end to my wandering</p>
<p>Here I played all my songs<br />
And I walked on a nightly journey<br />
Here in my youth I defended<br />
My own God&#8217;s little acre<br />
My own God&#8217;s little acre</p>
<p>Here I was born, here my children were born<br />
Here I built my home with my own two hands<br />
Here you are also with me and here are all off my thousand friends<br />
And after two thousand years, an end to my wandering</p>
<p>Here, here I set my table<br />
A piece of bread, a fresh flower<br />
I opened a door to the neighbours<br />
And we&#8217;ll say &#8220;Hi&#8221; to whoever comes (&#8220;Hi&#8221;)<br />
And we&#8217;ll say &#8220;Hi&#8221; to whoever comes</p>
<p>Here I was born, here my children were born<br />
Here I built my home with my own two hands<br />
Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends<br />
And after two thousand years, an end to my wandering</p>
<p>Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends<br />
And after two thousand years<br />
After two thousand years</p>
<p>Here I was born, here my children were born<br />
Here I built my home with my own two hands<br />
Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends<br />
And after two thousand years an end to my wandering</p>
<p>Here you are also with me and here are all of my thousand friends<br />
And after two thousand years<br />
An end, an end to my wandering<br />
