The underground is always late, and the trains don&#8217;t run<br />
But you have to make it to work anyway<br />
Your boss believes in overtime, otherwise you&#8217;re out<br />
But it&#8217;s already five o&#8217;clock, so it&#8217;s evening</p>
<p>And on the train on the way home<br />
When you fall asleep, the dream comes on its own</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause life is calling, your heart is beating<br />
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?<br />
And time is just passing by<br />
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?<br />
Come on</p>
<p>PTA meeting on Monday, and Tuesday in front of the TV<br />
On Wednesday she does yoga by herself<br />
On Thursday the girls come round, on Friday it&#8217;s the housework<br />
Candles and red wine Saturday evening</p>
<p>The whole Sunday in bed<br />
When she&#8217;s sleeping the dream returns once again</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause life is calling, your heart is beating<br />
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?<br />
And time is just passing by<br />
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?<br />
Come on</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause life is calling, your heart is beating<br />
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?<br />
And time is just passing by<br />
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you<br />
To the great Mrs. Thompson<br />
An everyday hero who leads the way<br />
Go for it and do it, Mrs. Thompson<br />
Come on</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause life is calling, your heart is beating<br />
And can you hear it, Mrs. Thompson?<br />
And time is just passing by<br />
But what are you doing, Mrs. Thompson?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the great&#8230;<br />
