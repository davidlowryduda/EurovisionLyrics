And they taught us to fight<br />
And we learnt to lose<br />
In the search for freedom<br />
We often let ourselves be seduced</p>
<p>Whatever they told us<br />
We believed in it all<br />
Although many words<br />
Were built of sand</p>
<p>But the time for lies will have to come to an end<br />
When there&#8217;s no more hate, we will be forever free</p>
<p>This dream must never die<br />
This dream must never disappear<br />
Many things must change<br />
And so much must happen</p>
<p>This dream must never die<br />
And a miracle will happen<br />
Once love triumphs<br />
And our dream will come true</p>
<p>On the way to the future<br />
Many wishes will come true<br />
But we reach for the stars<br />
And forget the danger</p>
<p>Nobody sees the shadow<br />
Following us at night<br />
Someone deals the cards<br />
And we are in his power</p>
<p>But the time for tears will have to come to an end<br />
When there is no more fear, we will be forever free</p>
<p>This dream must never die<br />
This dream must never disappear<br />
Many things must change<br />
And so much must happen</p>
<p>This dream must never die<br />
And a miracle will happen<br />
Once love triumphs<br />
And our dream will come true<br />
