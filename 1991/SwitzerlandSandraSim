I want to dream a little tonight<br />
To stop reality with four notes<br />
Then, joy comes back into my mind<br />
If there&#8217;s a song of mine</p>
<p>It once again shows what is inside of me<br />
In my smiles and your complicity<br />
Then give a kick to my sadness<br />
It&#8217;s now that you leave</p>
<p>Take me away with you, don&#8217;t ever leave me<br />
I don&#8217;t want to lose you, hold me tightly because<br />
There&#8217;s a song that will speak to you about me<br />
I&#8217;ll entrust it all my love for you</p>
<p>Then making out, sitting in a bar<br />
With my notes and a dream inside of me<br />
No, it doesn&#8217;t help to stop reality<br />
Close your eyes and go</p>
<p>Take me away with you, don&#8217;t ever leave me<br />
I don&#8217;t want to lose you, hold me tightly because<br />
There&#8217;s a song that will speak to you about me<br />
I&#8217;ll entrust it all my love for you</p>
<p>A song that sings and lives for you<br />
