I see people bowing their back<br />
As if life was a zero<br />
I&#8217;m fifteen and I tell you<br />
Whoa whoa&#8230; I love life<br />
(I love life, life, the whole life)</p>
<p>You have to believe in it, I also have<br />
Flashes of hope, of insomnia<br />
But in total, on the bill, I love the horizon</p>
<p>I love, I love life (Even if it&#8217;s madness)<br />
I love, I love life (Bravo for the challenge)<br />
I love, I love life, don&#8217;t hold it against me<br />
I was born that way<br />
I love, I love life</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; and no matter if it rains a bit much on me<br />
Whoa whoa&#8230; you&#8217;re there</p>
<p>Compared to Jacques Brel, to Mozart<br />
I feel so small, I&#8217;ve got the blues<br />
I&#8217;m just a speck of dust in this universe<br />
(That&#8217;s life, life, the whole life)</p>
<p>But as soon as you love me, as soon as you smile<br />
My joy goes on forever<br />
There&#8217;s no more Brel, no more Mozart, my life begins again</p>
<p>I love, I love life (Even if it&#8217;s madness)<br />
I love, I love life (Bravo for the challenge)<br />
I love, I love life, don&#8217;t hold it against me<br />
I was born that way<br />
I love, I love life</p>
<p>No matter if it rains a bit on me</p>
<p>I love, I love life (Even if it&#8217;s madness)<br />
I love, I love life (Bravo for the challenge)<br />
I love, I love life, don&#8217;t hold it against me<br />
I was born that way</p>
<p>I love, I love life (Even if it&#8217;s madness)<br />
I love, I love life (Bravo for the challenge)<br />
For those days when things don&#8217;t work out I have something to fall back on<br />
I&#8217;m counting on you<br />
I love, I love life</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; and no matter if it rains a bit much on me<br />
Whoa whoa&#8230; life &#8211; yes, you are there<br />
