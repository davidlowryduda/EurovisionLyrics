Enough words, come on, we go into the light<br />
There we will be seen, no, I&#8217;m not afraid<br />
Because your hand gives me a feeling of trust<br />
Let&#8217;s begin to build a bridge, whoa&#8230;.</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, understanding other people<br />
Other songs, other countries in the world<br />
Crossing the bridge, looking behind the wall<br />
Good thoughts melt the ice in the hearts of our world</p>
<p>We are only guests for a little time<br />
On this star filled with light and darkness<br />
What becomes of it also depends on you and me<br />
Open your heart and then the door will open, whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, understanding other people<br />
Other songs, other countries in the world<br />
Crossing the bridge, looking behind the wall<br />
Good thoughts melt the ice in the hearts of our world</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, to see the brighter sun<br />
The brighter morning, the brighter shine of our star<br />
Crossing the bridge, to see love grow brighter<br />
Good thoughts melt the ice in the hearts of our world</p>
<p>Our unique world<br />
