Time is lonely and it is tired<br />
It is tired of looking for you and stands still<br />
Time is lonely and looks for us both<br />
I alone cannot make it start again</p>
<p>For as long as you are not here time is so quiet<br />
I am so like it &#8211; time is lonely</p>
<p>I was always with you there<br />
Time didn&#8217;t know anything else<br />
Always beaming eyes<br />
It asks: Where is this light?</p>
<p>It asks: Where is the person<br />
I used to be when I was with you?<br />
It says, that I am alien to it<br />
Why do I come alone to it</p>
<p>Time is lonely and it is tired<br />
It is tired of looking for you and stands still</p>
<p>For as long as you&#8217;re not here it will not pass<br />
I am so like it &#8211; time is lonely<br />
