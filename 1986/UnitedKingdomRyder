<p>Goin&#8217; home, I&#8217;m a runner in the night<br />
Turnin&#8217; back with another chance to make it right<br />
I know where I went wrong, I&#8217;ve been away for far too long<br />
I&#8217;m on the track &#8211; I&#8217;m a runner in the night</p>
<p>You told me once not to go, I guess I wasn&#8217;t listening<br />
I was blind to reason then<br />
You were the light guidin&#8217; me, was so confused I could not see<br />
Without your love I wasn&#8217;t free</p>
<p>Goin&#8217; home, I&#8217;m a runner in the night<br />
Turnin&#8217; back with another chance to make it right<br />
I wanna start again, go back in time till I get to when<br />
I took your heart like a runner in the night</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t ask much of me, I didn&#8217;t make you promises<br />
You kept faith, I broke the rules<br />
I&#8217;m sorry now, my mistake, I didn&#8217;t mean that your heart should break<br />
I want you back, what will it take?<br />
Oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>I know I made you wait, I only hope it&#8217;s not too late<br />
To try again for a runner in the night</p>
<p>(Runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;)<br />
(Runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;)<br />
Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Goin&#8217; home, I&#8217;m a runner in the night, ooh&#8230;<br />
Touchin&#8217; down on the runway with the mornin&#8217; flight<br />
I know I made you wait, I only hope it&#8217;s not too late<br />
To try again for a runner in the night<br />
(Runnin&#8217;, runnin&#8217;)</p>
