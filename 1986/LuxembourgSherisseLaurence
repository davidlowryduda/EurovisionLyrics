I&#8217;ve got so much love in me for no reason<br />
My heart beats so much for no reason<br />
How I&#8217;d like to leave one day for love</p>
<p>Towards the man who&#8217;ll tell me for no reason<br />
Things that aren&#8217;t said for no reason<br />
Words more beautiful than children<br />
Stronger, bigger and higher than volcanoes</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fly without wings for the love of my life<br />
I&#8217;ll make suns to turn days into nights<br />
I&#8217;ll change time to keep longer<br />
The love of my life</p>
<p>I dream of a smile for no reason<br />
Of a rose he&#8217;ll give me for no reason<br />
And of a look coloured with hope<br />
Just like in the night, the shining stars in the dark</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fly without wings for the love of my life<br />
I&#8217;ll make suns to turn days into nights<br />
I&#8217;ll change time to keep longer<br />
The love of my life</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fly without wings for the love of my life<br />
I&#8217;ll make suns to turn days into nights<br />
I&#8217;ll change time to keep longer<br />
The love of my life</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll fly without wings for the love of my life<br />
I&#8217;ll make suns to turn days into nights<br />
I&#8217;ll change time to keep longer<br />
The love of my life<br />
