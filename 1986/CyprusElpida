A blue sky<br />
And golden sand is in my heart<br />
And in my dreams<br />
Everything becomes a dance</p>
<p>A far away exotic island<br />
You have, as a hidden flower<br />
In every one of your songs<br />
A purpose full of rhythm and melody</p>
<p>Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
I live what I was living in my dreams<br />
Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
Now I live and have you in my heart</p>
<p>A thousand birds sing<br />
The world becomes a feast<br />
Look at the stars now<br />
They becomes hot kisses</p>
<p>The moon plays hide and seek<br />
And dances on the seawave<br />
Everything goes right<br />
Like a sweet smile</p>
<p>Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
I live what I was living in my dreams<br />
Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
Now I live and have you in my heart</p>
<p>All, all, all for dance<br />
Music, song and rhythm<br />
Nana nanana&#8230;</p>
<p>All, all, all for dance<br />
Music, song and rhythm<br />
Nana nanana&#8230;</p>
<p>Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
I live what I was living in my dreams<br />
Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
Now I live and have you in my heart</p>
<p>Now, now I live, only now I live<br />
I live what I was living in my dreams<br />
Now, now I live, only, only now<br />
Now I live and have you in my heart<br />
