The good side of life<br />
The dream of knowing how to live<br />
It&#8217;s time to follow<br />
The new dawn</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be so angry with me, oh oh&#8230;<br />
I only want you, oh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>A love story with &#8216;L&#8217;<br />
I&#8217;m not counting on it, but I won&#8217;t forget it<br />
The good side of being with you<br />
Is kept in my senses</p>
<p>The crazy tapes, the wet kisses<br />
The short sentences, it&#8217;s all right<br />
I want to dance, to enjoy, to embrace<br />
The fire that&#8217;s burning inside of you</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be so angry with me, oh oh&#8230;<br />
I only want you, oh oh&#8230;<br />
Don&#8217;t be so angry with me, oh oh&#8230;<br />
I only want you, oh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a problem<br />
To imagine that everything is possible<br />
I have no idea how to change<br />
The colour of infinity</p>
<p>The sound of love, the magical kisses<br />
The in and the out, it&#8217;s all right<br />
Are you staying or are you going?<br />
I&#8217;m not waiting to see you, should I or not?</p>
<p>I only want you, oh oh&#8230;<br />
Don&#8217;t be so angry with me, oh oh&#8230;<br />
I only want you (Oh oh&#8230;)<br />
Don&#8217;t be so angry with me<br />
I only want you<br />
