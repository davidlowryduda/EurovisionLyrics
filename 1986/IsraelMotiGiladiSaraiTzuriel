<p>I want to live<br />
With the feeling that it will come<br />
Out of the faith that it will materialise<br />
Out of the love that has no name</p>

With the feeling that it will come<br />
Out of the faith that it will materialise<br />
Out of the love that has no name</p>
<p>Everybody wants to live<br />
With the feeling that it will come<br />
Out of that prayer that has a name<br />
That has a name</p>
<p>A day will come upon us<br />
A day will come, all of our children<br />
When the day comes will sing a song to the world<br />
That it will come</p>

A day will come, all of our children<br />
When the day comes will sing a song to the world<br />

With the feeling that it will come<br />
Out of the faith that&#8217;s in the heart<br />
Out of a little prayer that it will be considerate</p>

With the feeling that it will come<br />
With all the faith that&#8217;s in the heart<br />
Out of a little prayer that it will be considerate</p>

With the feeling that it will come<br />
Out of the prophecy of the sheep that loves the wolf</p>
<p>A day will come upon us<br />
A day will come, all of our children<br />
When the day comes will sing a song to the world<br />
That it will come, it will come</p>

A day will come, all of our children<br />
When the day comes will sing a song to the world<br />
That it will come, it will come<br />
