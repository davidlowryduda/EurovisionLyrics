I cannot live normally anymore<br />
Each day is different from the other<br />
And I&#8217;ve been trying to ignore you totally<br />
Even though I know you are unique</p>
<p>Emotions always burning are torment to me<br />
And yet I still want you for me<br />
Even though I suffer a longing for you<br />
I ask and demand an answer</p>
<p>Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)<br />
I don&#8217;t want to have any more<br />
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)<br />
There&#8217;s no point to it</p>
<p>Everything you do is concentrated on me<br />
You&#8217;ve become an obsession<br />
It&#8217;s easy for me to be fascinated by you<br />
You are loves irresistible force</p>
<p>Emotions always burning are torment to me<br />
Yet I still want you for me<br />
Even though I feel, I&#8217;m longing for you<br />
I ask and demand an answer</p>
<p>Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)<br />
I don&#8217;t want to have any more<br />
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)<br />
There&#8217;s no point to it</p>
<p>And every time you smile, something happens<br />
I plead and I pray, but no wonder happens</p>
<p>Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)<br />
I don&#8217;t want to have any more<br />
Is this what you call feelings? (This what you call feelings?)<br />
There&#8217;s no point to it</p>
<p>Is this what you call love? (This what you call love?)<br />
I don&#8217;t want to have any more<br />
Is this what you want?<br />
Of lovin&#8217; you the way that I do<br />
