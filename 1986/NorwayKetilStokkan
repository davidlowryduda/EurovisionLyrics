I remember the first time you asked me over<br />
I was shy, but in the mood for love<br />
Now the passion was to be tempted out<br />
It was too late to get nervous</p>
<p>I bought flowers and borrowed clothes<br />
To show my true desire<br />
But when I said &#8216;welcome on board&#8217;<br />
I got to hear a few well-chosen words:</p>
<p>Romeo, Romeo<br />
The Gods shall know that you never will become a<br />
Romeo, Romeo<br />
Try to take it easy</p>
<p>I made attempts at seducing you<br />
You asked for time to understand<br />
My greatest pleasure was to touch you<br />
My biggest stupidity was to feel you up</p>
<p>I played the part of lover and joker<br />
In the hope that we would become a couple<br />
But when you saw that I expected more<br />
I got to hear of a well-known partner</p>
<p>Romeo, Romeo<br />
The Gods shall know that you never will become a<br />
Romeo, Romeo<br />
Try to take it easy</p>
<p>Romeo, Romeo<br />
The Gods shall know that you never will become a<br />
Romeo, Romeo<br />
Try to take it easy</p>
<p>And when I fell down on my knees and begged<br />
You came towards me and said&#8230;<br />
You said:</p>
<p>Romeo, Romeo<br />
The Gods shall know that you never will become a<br />
Romeo, Romeo<br />
Try to take it easy Ro&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;meo, Romeo<br />
The Gods shall know that you never will become a<br />
Romeo, Romeo<br />
Try to take it easy<br />
Romeo<br />
