Time flies by in the age of satellites<br />
Faster every day, faster every night<br />
Are you sometimes pondering over the bounced cheques<br />
Perhaps you&#8217;re withdrawing too much from the Bank of Joy</p>
<p>Cheer up and tie up all loose ends<br />
Never deposit, only withdraw<br />
The sins that you never committed lie dormant<br />
An uncashed cheque from the Bank of Joy</p>
<p>You should sing a little song about the joy in life that&#8217;s in your heart<br />
And let the world know that you have a house of joy<br />
A cosy little song that can grab you at any time<br />
You don&#8217;t deposit your empty blues in the Bank of Joy</p>
<p>You should sing a little song about the joy in life that&#8217;s in your heart<br />

A cosy little song that can grab you at any time<br />

<p>Cheer up and tie up all loose ends<br />
