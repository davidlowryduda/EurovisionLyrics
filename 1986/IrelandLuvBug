<p>I was so happy with you, my hopes and dreams had all come true<br />
And our love shone for all the world to see<br />
As if you turned out the light, your love was gone overnight<br />
And all I&#8217;ve left â€“ the words you said to me</p>
<p>You can count on me, you can count on me<br />
Till the end of time, plus eternity<br />
You can count on me, you can count on me<br />
I&#8217;ll be by your side, you can count on me</p>
<p>I see despair all around, all of the world is upside down<br />
And there&#8217;s no light ahead that I can see<br />
If we could only be friends, give it a chance and try again<br />
Maybe we can relive the words you said to me</p>
<p>You can count on me, you can count on me<br />
Till the end of time, plus eternity<br />
You can count on me (On me, don&#8217;t you know?), you can count on me<br />
I&#8217;ll be by your side, you can count on me</p>
<p>(You can count on, you can count on)<br />
(Don&#8217;t you know you can count on me?)<br />
I&#8217;ll be by your side, you can count on me</p>
<p>You can count on me (On me, don&#8217;t you know?), you can count on me<br />
Count on me till the end of time, plus eternity<br />
You can count on me (On me, don&#8217;t you know?), you can count on me<br />
Count on me, I&#8217;ll be by your side, by your side, you can count on me</p>
