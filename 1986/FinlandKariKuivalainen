Over the mountains, beyond the seas<br />
My mind banishes the past<br />
A little boy is a grown person<br />
After he can create a new beginning</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t sleep till the next morning<br />
I&#8217;m awake, and wondering why I can&#8217;t find<br />
I don&#8217;t want a bigger world<br />
Just one day, one tomorrow<br />
I will never say the end</p>
<p>The city lights, the echo music<br />
They stay in the foggy web<br />
I have lost so much, I&#8217;m still looking for you<br />
Like a world that has disappeared</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t sleep till the next morning<br />
I&#8217;m awake, and wondering why I can&#8217;t find<br />
I don&#8217;t want a bigger world<br />
Just one day, one tomorrow<br />
I will never say the end</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t sleep till the next morning<br />
I&#8217;m awake, and wondering why I can&#8217;t find<br />
I don&#8217;t want a bigger world<br />
Just one day, one tomorrow<br />
I will never say the end<br />
