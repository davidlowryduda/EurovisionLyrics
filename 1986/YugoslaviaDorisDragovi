I loved you and still do<br />
I give it all truly<br />
This night is dark without you</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s luck, you&#8217;ll come back<br />
My punishment, my sin<br />
Quiet, quiet, my tear, don&#8217;t give up</p>
<p>My desire, my sorrow<br />
I&#8217;m still yours, you&#8217;re still mine (You&#8217;re still mine)<br />
Everything is aching because of you<br />
My desire, my sorrow</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s luck, you&#8217;ll come back<br />
My punishment, my sin<br />
Quiet, quiet, my tear, don&#8217;t give up</p>
<p>My desire, my sorrow<br />
I&#8217;m still yours, you&#8217;re still mine (You&#8217;re still mine)<br />
Everything is aching because of you<br />
My desire, my sorrow</p>
<p>Everything is aching because of you<br />
My desire, my sorrow<br />
