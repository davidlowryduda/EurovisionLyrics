We feel like going away<br />
When there&#8217;s no more sunshine in the house<br />
We want to take off<br />
A few hours in a plane to change everything</p>
<p>Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Capri<br />
It&#8217;s super to do a thousand foolish things</p>
<p>We&#8217;re European girls<br />
And the things we love<br />
We find them here, from London to Paris<br />
Even if the music is connected<br />
Live from Radio L.A.</p>
<p>European girls, and when we love someone<br />
It&#8217;s the French love, a bit liberated<br />
We like the old continent<br />
With background music USA</p>
<p>We all have in our hearts<br />
A song about Indian summer<br />
Colour posters<br />
Of African sunsets</p>
<p>We prefer the smile of Italy<br />
England, Boy George and Lady Di</p>
<p>We&#8217;re European girls<br />
And the things we love<br />
We find them here, from London to Paris<br />
Even if the music is connected<br />
Live from Radio L.A.</p>
<p>European girls, and when we love someone<br />
It&#8217;s the French love, a bit liberated<br />
We like the old continent<br />
With background music USA<br />
Hey&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all European girls<br />
And the things we love<br />
We find them here, from London to Paris<br />
The weather is nice in California<br />
But Saint-Tropez is also good</p>
<p>European girls<br />
