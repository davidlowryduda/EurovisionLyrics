Not for me, all those adventures<br />
Not for me, easy come and easy go<br />
Not for me, those tricks after evenings at the disco</p>
<p>Not for me, I can&#8217;t stand<br />
With advances anywhere<br />
Be it at the opera or in the underground</p>
<p>I want a love written in capitals<br />
I want a story that lasts a lifetime</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t unfold my wings<br />
For a one night stand, no, that&#8217;s not it<br />
I want love, love the way it used to be<br />
Tender feelings, that&#8217;s what I want from you</p>
<p>Not for me, all those extravagances<br />
The parties, certain holidays<br />
The follies that one regrets later in life</p>
<p>Not for me, I don&#8217;t trust<br />
Those with experience<br />
No thanks, all that was not really made for me</p>
<p>I want a love written in capitals<br />
I want a story that lasts a lifetime</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t unfold my wings<br />
For a one night stand, no, that&#8217;s not it<br />
I want love, love the way it used to be<br />
Tender feelings, that&#8217;s what I want from you</p>
<p>I want love, love the way it used to be<br />
Tender feelings, that&#8217;s what I want from you<br />
And why isn&#8217;t it that?<br />
