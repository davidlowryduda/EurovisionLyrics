Seven o&#8217; clock, you have to get out of your bed<br />
Your mother is shouting from the corridor:<br />
&#8220;Come on girl, how long is it going to take?&#8221;</p>
<p>Listen up, I&#8217;m only just dreaming<br />
A quarter past seven, I still have all the time<br />
Because getting up doesn&#8217;t take an eternity</p>
<p>It always goes this way<br />
You always try it again and again<br />
In your own way, every time a little harder</p>
<p>Take the time for everything, live your own rhythm<br />
You can make everything swing in your own rhythm<br />
Rhythm is in all people and you can learn how to swing<br />
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everything has a rhythm</p>
<p>The whole day you&#8217;ve been running again<br />
Quarter past six, you&#8217;re not in time once again<br />
Now, who whines about a futility like that?</p>
<p>Oh, in time, I just can&#8217;t get used to it<br />
Listen up, does it matter?<br />
Because I&#8217;m going my own way anyway</p>
<p>It always goes this way<br />
You always try it again<br />
In your own way, every time a little harder</p>
<p>Take the time for everything, live your own rhythm<br />
You can make everything swing in your own rhythm<br />
Rhythm is in all people and you can learn how to swing<br />
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everything has a rhythm</p>
<p>Take the time for everything, live your own rhythm<br />
You can make everything swing in your own rhythm<br />
Rhythm is in all people and you can learn how to swing<br />
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, everything has a rhythm<br />
Everything has a rhythm, everything has a rhythm, everything has a rhythm<br />
