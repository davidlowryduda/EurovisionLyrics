Hello, forgive me my love<br />
Tonight I&#8217;m writing the last letter to you<br />
I teared up thousands of them<br />
Because I will leave you, but don&#8217;t know how to tell it<br />
You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born</p>
<p>Love is a moment, love is a moment<br />
But life is a storm, stronger than us</p>
<p>And go, sadness, go<br />
For her there is a thought and a tear<br />
Goodbye, good luck<br />
You&#8217;ll see the wounds will heal</p>
<p>Who knows if there will be a flower<br />
For you under the snow</p>
<p>(Lala lala lala&#8230; lala lala lala&#8230;)<br />
(Lala lala lala lala lala lala&#8230;)</p>
<p>One month has passed<br />
And I already give in to melancholy<br />
My only friend<br />
Is the train that brings me home<br />
You said that the one that can tear us apart will never be born</p>
<p>Love is a moment, love is a moment<br />
But life is a storm, stronger than us</p>
<p>And go, sadness, go<br />
For her there is a thought and a tear<br />
Goodbye, good luck<br />
You&#8217;ll see the wounds will heal</p>
<p>Who knows if there will be a flower<br />
For you under the snow</p>
<p>Who knows if there will be a flower<br />
For you under the snow<br />
