<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
You sent me your dreams<br />
But that wasn&#8217;t enough<br />
I asked you to come yourself<br />
I asked it way too early</p>
<p>Desire is a blossom<br />
And a blossom becomes a fruit<br />
And storms are composed<br />
Of breath, sigh by sigh</p>
<p>You sent me stories<br />
I read them way too quick<br />
A necklace with thousand beads<br />
And still you weren&#8217;t back</p>
<p>A bird migrates southward<br />
On the exact hour and day<br />
And those who didn&#8217;t shed tears<br />
Don&#8217;t recognise a real laugh</p>
<p>You come to warm me<br />
The dot is coming closer<br />
I can almost feel your arms<br />
The waiting is over</p>
<p>The time sets the rhythm<br />
And goes its own way<br />
And someone who wants to go even faster<br />
Makes it twice as long<br />
