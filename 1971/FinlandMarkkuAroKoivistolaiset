<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
There&#8217;s a piece of land and a piece of water<br />
And a piece of burning fire<br />
There&#8217;s a human mind and bad tongue<br />
Doesn&#8217;t want to put out the fire</p>
<p>All that will lead us to a new day<br />
Is there a reason to worry for the future now?<br />
When you meet other people on the way<br />
And everything is so nice</p>
<p>Now everyone goes there to the new day<br />
And others show, where you can find the way<br />
If you once close your eyes from tomorrow<br />
The easy road takes you along</p>
<p>The world is now ready<br />
The unchanging knowledge is now guiding<br />
The time, so immeasurable<br />
Has it already ended after serving us?</p>
<p>When one takes, and another one gives<br />
And a third one shouts thirsty<br />
You don&#8217;t know them, they don&#8217;t know us<br />
And we go the same way</p>
<p>All that will lead us to a new day<br />
Is there a reason to worry for the future now?<br />
When you meet other people on the way<br />
And everything is so nice</p>
<p>Now everyone goes there to the new day<br />
And others show, where you can find the way<br />
If you once close your eyes from tomorrow<br />
The easy road takes you along</p>
<p>Now everyone goes there to the new day<br />
And others show, where you can find the way<br />
If you once close your eyes from tomorrow<br />
The easy road takes you along<br />
