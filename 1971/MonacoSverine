We all have a bench, a tree, a street<br />
Where we cherished our dreams<br />
We all have a bench, a tree, a street<br />
A childhood that has been too short</p>
<p>One day or another we have to leave<br />
To build a future, a future<br />
And it&#8217;s the unforgettable instant<br />
When we return our child clothes, child clothes</p>
<p>Everyone goes, filled with hope<br />
On the road that they chose, that they chose<br />
To the richness or to the glory<br />
Yet what our life will be, our life</p>
<p>We all have a bench, a tree, a street<br />
Where we cherished our dreams<br />
We all have a bench, a tree, a street<br />
A childhood that has been too short</p>
<p>Everyone, in his corner of the horizon<br />
Only defends their ambitions, their ambitions<br />
But if we share nothing<br />
What will be left for us in common, in common?</p>
<p>We all have a bench, a tree, a street<br />
Where we cherished our dreams<br />
We all have a bench, a tree, a street<br />
A childhood that has been too short</p>
<p>Lalala lala&#8230; lala lala lala&#8230;<br />
Lalala lalala lala&#8230;<br />
