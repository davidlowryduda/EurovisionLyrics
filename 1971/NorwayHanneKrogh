<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
There is happiness on earth, just not where you expect<br />
It&#8217;s not money in the bank, a tiger in your petrol-tank<br />
Happiness is all you wish for</p>
<p>Happiness is a bucket of sand in the small hand of a child<br />
Happiness is a greeting from the gang, breakfast in bed<br />
Happiness is herring in dill</p>
<p>If you look around, a thousand things<br />
Will give you some of the happiness you seek<br />
Yes, it exists where you are<br />
It&#8217;s only you it&#8217;s waiting for</p>
<p>Happiness is an old hat<br />
Which used to belong to your best friend<br />
Happiness is an hour in the bath, warm chocolate<br />
Happiness is this and that</p>
<p>Happiness is crystal clear water<br />
Your fingers in sand hot from the sun<br />
Walking barefoot in the grass, with no address<br />
Happiness is you and me</p>
<p>Happiness is to celebrate the end of high school<br />
And to catch the last bus<br />
Happiness is among the trees in the park, hearts on a tree-bark<br />
Happiness is living it up</p>
<p>If you sing a song, try for once<br />
To pretend it was written to you<br />
Try this one, happiness is<br />
After all, something you seek along the way</p>
<p>Happiness is a milk tooth, in a small glass of water<br />
Getting tax money back, letting in the cat<br />
Happiness is such and so</p>
<p>Happiness is like a wind, like a sunbeam in your heart<br />
Happiness is the content of the song, small details<br />
Happiness is yours and mine</p>
<p>Happiness is like a wind, like a sunbeam in your heart<br />
Happiness is the content of the song, small details<br />
Happiness is yours and mine<br />
