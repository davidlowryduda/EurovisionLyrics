I still think of the one who<br />
Doesn&#8217;t sleep beside me anymore<br />
The night is long and dark like pain<br />
The bed is empty, and so is the table</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where she lives and whether she knows<br />
That I still dream of her, somewhere without her<br />
Because someone else is with her on a faraway journey<br />
To the stars and beyond, without me</p>
<p>In some garden, you&#8217;re still a rose<br />
While I can&#8217;t sleep, you know I&#8217;m feeling sad</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t call me anymore, you know that<br />
My journey is over without you</p>
<p>In another garden, you&#8217;re still a rose<br />
Your boy dreams of you, your boy is sad<br />
