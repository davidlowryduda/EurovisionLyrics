<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
By persistently running to discover nothing<br />
By only being adventurer in memories<br />
Or by travelling like doing business<br />
And by losing our youth like winning a war</p>
<p>We end up saying that nothing&#8217;s important<br />
That we have nothing else to say, that we wasted our time</p>
<p>A garden on earth, a little lost corner<br />
Just a swindle, a shelter, nothing else<br />
A garden on earth to cultivate our heart<br />
And to take the best as a short success</p>
<p>Sowing, being sure that we give life<br />
From the grain to the leafbud and from the flower to the fruit<br />
A garden on earth, a premature Eden<br />
A garden on earth, isn&#8217;t that happiness?</p>
<p>By persistently wanting to live together for a lifetime<br />
Unto the point of pairing with no matter who<br />
Or by making some battlefields with our bed<br />
Collecting hearts instead of medals</p>
<p>We end up saying that nothing&#8217;s important<br />
That we have nothing else to say, that we wasted our time</p>
<p>A garden on earth, a little lost corner<br />
Just a swindle, a shelter, nothing else<br />
A garden on earth to cultivate our heart<br />
And to take the best as a short success</p>
<p>Sowing, being sure that we give life<br />
From the grain to the leafbud and from the flower to the fruit<br />
A garden on earth, a premature Eden<br />
Give me a garden on earth<br />
