Gentleman, you who have the experience of things in life<br />
Gentleman, you who have survived your life<br />
Let us now have our turn to live too</p>
<p>Oh, you who have remade the world and the time like us<br />
Let us dream, dream now<br />
Leave us the illusions of our twenties</p>
<p>Madam, you who have memories of the roses of life<br />
Madam, you who have been so beautiful<br />
Let us have our turn to love and live too</p>
<p>Oh, you who in the past only dreamt about waltzes and springs<br />
Let us dance, dance now<br />
Leave us the illusions of our twenties</p>
<p>Leave us the illusions of our twenties<br />
Twenties&#8230; twenties&#8230;<br />
