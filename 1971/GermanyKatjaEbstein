Starlit nights and the air is like jasmine<br />
Rivers as clear as crystal and forests lush green<br />
Is this still possible, or is it already too late<br />
For this dream to be fulfilled for everyone everywhere?</p>
<p>This world, this world is a gift which life gave us<br />
It&#8217;s yours, it&#8217;s mine, it&#8217;s beautiful to live on<br />
And what will happen is up to you</p>
<p>Smoke from a thousand chimneys is lowering over city and country<br />
Where yesterday children were, now oil covers the beach<br />
In jumbo jets we fly towards tomorrow<br />
What will tomorrow be like, senseless or full of sunshine?</p>
<p>This world, this world is a gift which life gave us<br />
It&#8217;s yours, it&#8217;s mine, it&#8217;s beautiful to live on<br />
And what will happen is up to you</p>
<p>This world, this world is a gift which life gave us<br />
It&#8217;s yours, it&#8217;s mine, it&#8217;s beautiful to live on<br />
And what will happen is up to you</p>
<p>And even if it is just a piece of dust floating in infinity<br />
Only this star is our star, the others are too far away</p>
<p>This world, this world is a gift which life gave us<br />
It&#8217;s yours, it&#8217;s mine, it&#8217;s beautiful to live on<br />
And what will happen is up to you</p>
<p>This world, this world is a gift which life gave us<br />
It&#8217;s yours, it&#8217;s mine, it&#8217;s beautiful to live on<br />
And what will happen is up to you</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230; is up to you<br />
Ooh&#8230; is up to you<br />
