Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, red carpet<br />
Apple, apple, small red apple, I&#8217;m going to bite the<br />
Apple, apple, apple, and then<br />
When I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;ll begin all over again</p>
<p>Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, green carpet<br />
Apple, apple, small red apple, it seems like in the<br />
Apple, apple, apple, there are a bunch of pips<br />
Too bad, I&#8217;ll see</p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s springtime, it&#8217;s springtime<br />
And I&#8217;m not even twenty yet</p>
<p>Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, blue carpet<br />
Blue, blue like the sky before biting the<br />
Apple, apple, small red apple<br />
I&#8217;d like to know what&#8217;s in there</p>
<p>Is it love? My Prince Charming<br />
In the middle of the woods hidden in my<br />
Apple, apple, apple? Tell me<br />
Is it love, love or the snake?</p>
<p>Oh, while waiting, it&#8217;s springtime<br />
And I&#8217;m not even twenty yet</p>
<p>Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, white carpet<br />
When it&#8217;s the snake, I&#8217;m not afraid, I have my<br />
Apple, apple, gilded apple<br />
And I have all summer long to run in the field</p>
<p>Apple, apple, beautiful apple, carpet, grey carpet<br />
But if it&#8217;s love, I&#8217;ll tell him very softly<br />
Come, come, come with me<br />
Come, I waited for you, come, I counted the days</p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s springtime, it&#8217;s springtime<br />
And I&#8217;m not even twenty yet</p>
<p>Apple, apple, small red apple, carpet, red carpet<br />
Apple, apple, small red apple, I&#8217;m going to bite the<br />
Apple, apple, apple, and then<br />
When I&#8217;m done, I&#8217;ll begin all over again</p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s springtime<br />
Oh, it&#8217;s springtime<br />
