Sunny beaches, green swaying palms<br />
Mediterranean countries, dark nights, warm, pleasant<br />
That&#8217;s where you want to live, I have another paradise</p>
<p>White expanses, sparkling frozen crust<br />
Mountains with snow as far as you can see<br />
Deep forests, grouse and hare<br />
Eternal sun that never sets</p>
<p>Here is my world and I want to share it with you<br />
If you want to be by my side<br />
You want to be by my side</p>
<p>As long as we understand each other, then the world is ours<br />
Sun over a beach or sun over a snowy white winter landscape</p>
<p>Warm winds make little waves in the sand<br />
Mediterranean winds bring our boat to the shore<br />
That&#8217;s how you want to live, I have another paradise</p>
<p>Snow that whirls around my skis<br />
Down steep dizzying slopes<br />
Gliding down the sides of the mountain edge<br />
Alone between heaven and abyss</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my world and I want to share it with you<br />
If you want to be by my side<br />
You want to be by my side</p>
<p>As long as we understand each other, then the the world is ours<br />
