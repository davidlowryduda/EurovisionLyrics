Only at the end of the road you&#8217;ll see things clear<br />
The reason to live and causes of a thousand more things<br />
When you&#8217;re looking back, when you&#8217;re there, you&#8217;ll understand</p>
<p>Search for simple things and you&#8217;ll find the truth<br />
The truth of that love, let go of the rest<br />
Just love won&#8217;t die in time</p>
<p>At the end of the road<br />
All the dreams that you have inside will come true<br />
If in some point of your road<br />
You have filled your life with love and truth</p>
<p>At the end of the road<br />
You can find the good you hoped to feel<br />
Forget the past, because it won&#8217;t come back<br />
Keep the love you have in you</p>
<p>At the end of the road<br />
There I&#8217;ll be awakening, to start living again<br />
If in some point of your road<br />
You have filled your life with love and truth</p>
<p>At the end of the road<br />
You&#8217;ll have inside the faith and the joy of living<br />
All your dreams will always come true<br />
In a new happy world</p>
<p>At the end of the road<br />
You&#8217;ll have inside the faith and the joy of living<br />
All your dreams will always come true<br />
In a new happy world</p>
<p>In a new happy world<br />
In a new happy world</p>
<p>All your dreams will always come true<br />
If you fill your life with love and peace<br />
If you fill your life with love and peace<br />
In a new happy world<br />
