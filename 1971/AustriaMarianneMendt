Everywhere, where you look around<br />
People make music<br />
Often it&#8217;s sold as something what it really isn&#8217;t</p>
<p>Then it&#8217;s packed nicely<br />
With lights on the top<br />
And it&#8217;s sent as an escape into paradise</p>
<p>Not the light, not the glamour<br />
Not the show is what music is about<br />
Like the wind, like a dream<br />
It has to be the language of fantasy and freedom</p>
<p>The language that we speak<br />
Is not enough at all<br />
You have to be able to tell someone what you feel</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why music is made<br />
It won&#8217;t be different<br />
What&#8217;s around it, only confuses me</p>
<p>Not the light, not the glamour<br />
Not the show is what music is about<br />
Like the wind, like a dream<br />
It has to be the language of fantasy and freedom</p>
<p>Not the light, not the glamour<br />
Not the show is what music is about<br />
Like the wind, like a dream<br />
It has to be the language of fantasy and freedom<br />
