<p>You love for a day<br />
Then you go on your way<br />
Breaking hearts, lonely hearts<br />
Though they want you to stay</p>
<p>Then you laugh, how you laugh<br />
When the tears start to fall<br />
Turn your back, one day love<br />
Wave your hand to them all</p>
<p>Yesterday, lovely day<br />
I was yours for a while<br />
In your arms there was peace<br />
As you kissed with a smile</p>
<p>Words of love, empty words<br />
Whispered close to my ear<br />
They were lies, only lies<br />
But I held them so dear</p>
<p>How can you be so deceiving?<br />
Why do you injure my pride?<br />
Building me up with your promises<br />
Only to throw me aside</p>
<p>How many hearts have you broken<br />
Closing your ears to their cries?<br />
How many times have you cheated and lied<br />
With a look of deceit in your eyes?</p>
<p>One day soon, very soon<br />
Deep in love you will fall<br />
And the one that you want<br />
Will not answer your call</p>
<p>So beware and have care<br />
Take advice from a friend<br />
Your kind of love, one day love<br />
Will come to an end</p>
<p>How can you be so deceiving?<br />
Why do you injure my pride?<br />
Building me up with your promises<br />
Only to throw me aside</p>
<p>How many hearts have you broken<br />
Closing your ears to their cries?<br />
How many times have you cheated and lied<br />
With a look of deceit in your eyes?</p>
<p>One day soon, very soon<br />
Deep in love you will fall<br />
And the one that you want<br />
Will not answer your call</p>
<p>So beware and have care<br />
Take advice from a friend<br />
Your kind of love, one day love<br />
Will end</p>
