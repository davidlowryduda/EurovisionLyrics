I&#8217;ve done it all, as a little child<br />

A little boy, searching for his home<br />
Giving up to a sin for a heart-craving dream<br />
Is that a sin?</em></font></p>

Then surely that love would love<br />
Then surely that love would love to love you back</em></font></p>

<p>Wait, wait a little<br />
Wait, wait a little, be with me<br />
Love, give me love, pray only on it<br />
Pray, without it you are a mirage<br />
A lonely hero</p>

Without love you are a mirage, a lonely hero<br />
A lonely hero<br />
