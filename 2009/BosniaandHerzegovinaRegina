<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I asked some people<br />
In the neighbourhood, where my soul resides<br />
A secret from me<br />
They say you are hiding, dear</p>
<p>I asked that they return to me<br />
That time, the old hours, the spring<br />
That love is in the air<br />
They say</p>
<p>Give birth to me at dawn in May<br />
Bathe me in the clear water<br />
I guard one world, when all others leave<br />
I guard you as long as I&#8217;m alive</p>
<p>Steal a bit of sun for us<br />
There&#8217;s no tomorrow, there&#8217;s no today<br />
It all becomes easy as the song finds the heart</p>
<p>Give birth to me at dawn in May<br />
Bathe me in the clear water<br />
I guard one world, when all others leave<br />
I guard you as long as I&#8217;m alive</p>
<p>Give birth to me at dawn in May<br />
Bathe me in the clear water<br />
I guard one world, when all others leave<br />
I guard you as long as I&#8217;m alive<br />
