<p>Take a chance, and take a hold<br />
Give it all and turn it to gold<br />
Time has come, so make a stand<br />
On your own and take command</p>
<p>Beat the odds, you will survive<br />
Stronger now, you feel alive<br />
Rising up, get into place<br />
Feel it in your heart when you are winning this race</p>
<p>When I look into your eyes<br />
It comes as no surprise</p>
<p>This is our night, fly to the top, baby<br />
Yes, we can do it, just wait and see<br />
This is our night, time for a change, baby<br />
Get rid of the old, take a hold and be free</p>
<p>This is our night, fly to the top, baby<br />
Yes, we can do it, just wait and see<br />
This is our night, time for a change, baby<br />
Get rid of the old, take a hold and be free<br />
This is our night</p>
<p>Counting down, the night of nights<br />
Getting now to stand and fight<br />
Don&#8217;t back down, just look within<br />
Do it now, I know you will</p>
<p>When I look into your eyes<br />
It comes as no surprise</p>
<p>This is our night, fly to the top, baby<br />
Yes, we can do it, just wait and see<br />
This is our night, time for a change, baby<br />
Get rid of the old, take a hold and be free<br />
This is our night</p>
<p>This is our night, fly to the top, baby<br />
Yes, we can do it, just wait and see<br />
This is our night, time for a change, baby<br />
Get rid of the old, take a hold and be free</p>
<p>This is our night, fly to the top, baby<br />
Yes, we can do it, just wait and see<br />
This is our night, time for a change, baby<br />
Get rid of the old, take a hold and be free<br />
This is our night</p>
