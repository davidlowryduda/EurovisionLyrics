<p>You made it so easy<br />
To fall, I could not stand at all<br />
I saw you beside me<br />
You never saw me there at all</p>
<p>I promised you all this<br />
I made plans thinking this was it<br />
I never imagined<br />
I&#8217;d find you and lose myself instead</p>
<p>I never had a picture of an end</p>
<p>And I, I wanna believe in love<br />
I wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us<br />
I, I wanna breathe again<br />
I wanna go back to the days, the days I had my innocence<br />
I wanna believe again</p>
<p>I picked up the pieces<br />
And put them back where they belong<br />
But something is missing<br />
Though I look the same, I&#8217;m not that strong</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m gonna learn to trust again</p>
<p>And I, I wanna believe in love<br />
I wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us<br />
And I, I wanna breathe again<br />
I wanna go back to the days, the days I had my innocence<br />
I wanna believe again</p>
<p>For without love, what do we become?<br />
I never had a picture of an end</p>
<p>And I, I wanna believe in love<br />
I wanna believe in something bigger than the two of us<br />
And I, I wanna breathe again<br />
I wanna go back to the days, the days I had my innocence<br />
I wanna believe again</p>
