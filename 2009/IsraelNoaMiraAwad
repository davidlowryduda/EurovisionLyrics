<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>There must be another<br />
Must be another way</em></font></p>
<p>Your eyes, sister<br />
Say all that my heart desires<br />
So far, we&#8217;ve gone<br />
A long way, a very difficult way, hand in hand</p>
<p>And the tears fall, pour in vain<br />
A pain with no name<br />
We wait<br />
Only for the next day to come</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>There must be another way<br />
There must be another way</em></font></p>
<p>Your eyes say<br />
A day will come and all fear will disappear<br />
In your eyes a determination<br />
That there is a possibility<br />
To carry on the way as long as it may take</p>
<p>For there is no single address for sorrow<br />
I call out to the horizons<br />
To the stubborn heavens</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>There must be another way<br />
There must be another way<br />
There must be another<br />
Must be another way</em></font></p>
<p>We will go a long way<br />
A very difficult way together to the light<br />
Your eyes say<br />
All fear will disappear</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And when I cry, I cry for both of us<br />
My pain has no name<br />
And when I cry, I cry<br />
To the merciless sky and say<br />
There must be another way</em></font></p>
<p>And the tears fall, pour in vain<br />
A pain with no name<br />
We wait<br />
Only for the day to come</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>There must be another way<br />
There must be another way<br />
There must be another<br />
Must be another way</em></font><br />
