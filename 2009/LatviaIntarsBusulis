Traffic jam &#8211; everyone&#8217;s tired of this<br />
Gloomy faces, nerves, I have to be the one to get through<br />
And steel boxes appearing everywhere<br />
Suddenly I see a girl above, jumping on roofs</p>
<p>Jumping straight ahead<br />
From a Mercedes to a Volvo<br />
I rub my eyes, it could be a mirage<br />
But my eyes already hurt</p>
<p>Hey, take me there with you<br />
I&#8217;m tired of giving up<br />
I want to walk on bumpers<br />
In fact, nothing is holding me back</p>
<p>Only, I don&#8217;t know who you are<br />
But I just want to be near you<br />
To see how below the wind is bending bushes<br />
At the side of the packed ring road</p>
<p>I see a fist out of a window<br />
&#8220;Damn you!&#8221;<br />
And I do a jump-hop, shredding my pants<br />
I left, let it pass, going on like crazy<br />
The air is pure CO<sub>2</sub> &#8211; my head is spinning</p>
<p>This is no easy fun<br />
From a Mercedes to a Volvo<br />
And rushing to your silhouette<br />
Very far away</p>
<p>Hey, take me with you forever<br />
I&#8217;m tired of giving up<br />
I want to walk on bumpers<br />
In fact, nothing is holding me back</p>
<p>Hey, take me up there with you<br />
I&#8217;m tired of giving up<br />
I want to walk on bumpers<br />
In fact, nothing is holding me back</p>
<p>Hey, take me up there with you<br />
I&#8217;m tired of giving up<br />
I want to walk on bumpers<br />
In fact, nothing is holding me back<br />
