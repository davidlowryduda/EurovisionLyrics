In the desert heat the sand<br />
Blows like ice-cold snow<br />
The night soon spreads its wings<br />
Leaving nothing but the wind to escort the nomads</p>
<p>This is the way they wander from one day to the next<br />
This is the way they wander from one life to the next<br />
This is the way it weaves an invisible path<br />
Before them waiting until you are ready to take the risk</p>
<p>It carries only frozen souls<br />
The moonlight makes their shadows<br />
Warmth in a ray of sunlight<br />
Is what the morning brings once again</p>
<p>This is the way they wander from one day to the next<br />
This is the way they wander from one life to the next<br />
This is the way it weaves an invisible path<br />
Before them waiting until you are ready to take the risk</p>
<p>They wander from one day to the next<br />
They wander from one life to the next<br />
It weaves an invisible path<br />
Waiting until you are ready to take the risk</p>
<p>A voice echoes over the mountains up to the heavens</p>
<p>This is the way they wander from one day to the next<br />
This is the way they wander from one life to the next<br />
This is the way it weaves an invisible path<br />
Before them waiting until you are ready to take the risk</p>
<p>This is the way<br />
