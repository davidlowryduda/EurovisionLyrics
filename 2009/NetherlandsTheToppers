<p>(Shine, shine, shine)</p>
<p>There are so many wars right now in this world<br />
There are so many things not right<br />
There are too many people hurt in this world<br />
There are too many men that fight</p>
<p>Time is now to make the change<br />
Time is on our side<br />
Love will make us glow in the dark<br />
So open up your heart<br />
Are you ready for a brand new start?</p>
<p>(Shine)<br />
People, let your light shine<br />
Let the darkness fade away<br />
Step into a brighter day<br />
Don&#8217;t forget about our world today</p>
<p>Let your light shine<br />
Maybe the answer is just this simple song<br />
Let everybody shine along<br />
To keep the world from going wrong<br />
Let your light shine</p>
<p>So many people with good heart in this world<br />
So many, they can make a change<br />
So the only thing that we have to do<br />
Is love the one we hate</p>
<p>It will change all darkness into bright<br />
It will touch everybody&#8217;s light<br />
The whole world will be lighted<br />
All people will be reunited</p>
<p>(Shine)<br />
People, let your light shine<br />
Let the darkness fade away<br />
Step into a brighter day<br />
Don&#8217;t forget about the role you must play</p>
<p>Let your light shine<br />
Maybe the answer is just this simple song<br />
Let everybody shine along<br />
To keep the world from going wrong<br />
Let your light shine</p>
<p>As long as we believe in good in each man<br />
As long as we believe in love<br />
The light will guide and take us to<br />
The world we all dream of<br />
Let your light shine</p>
<p>(Shine)<br />
People, let your light shine<br />
Maybe the answer is just this simple song<br />
Let everybody shine along<br />
To keep the world from going wrong</p>
<p>Let your light shine<br />
Shine, shine, shine, shine</p>
