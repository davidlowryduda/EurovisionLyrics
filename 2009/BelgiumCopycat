<p>Way down in Memphis, Tennessee<br />
There&#8217;s a guy looking just like me<br />
Wearing the same blue suede shoes<br />
Singing the same old blues</p>
<p>Way down in the U.S. of A.<br />
There&#8217;s a guy doing things my way<br />
Combing the same greasy hair<br />
Hugging the same teddy bear</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a copycat trying to steal my soul<br />
But he&#8217;s too fat to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
He&#8217;s a copycat trying to steal my soul<br />
But he&#8217;s too fat to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll</p>
<p>Way down in the deep deep South<br />
There&#8217;s a guy with a girly mouth<br />
Eating the same banana sandwich<br />
Dressed in the same kind of kitsch</p>
<p>Way down by the Mississippi river<br />
There&#8217;s a guy with a voice that quivers<br />
Driving the same Cadillac car<br />
Chasing the same lucky star</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a copycat trying to steal my soul<br />
But he&#8217;s too fat to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
He&#8217;s a copycat trying to steal my soul<br />
But he&#8217;s too fat to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll</p>
<p>Way down in America<br />
There&#8217;s a guy, rich and arrogant<br />
Dating my fair Priscilla<br />
He makes me want to hire a killer!</p>
<p>Way down in the land of the brave<br />
There&#8217;s a guy lying in his grave<br />
Cause nobody duplicating my jive<br />
Will never get away with that alive</p>
<p>He was a copycat trying to steal my soul<br />
Now he&#8217;s too dead to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
He was a copycat trying to steal my soul<br />
Now he&#8217;s too dead to rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll</p>
