Out of the shadows once again, my enemy, my love<br />
My destiny can&#8217;t be avoided, no matter how much you&#8217;re prepared<br />
But before you left with a golden ring<br />
You proposed to me and didn&#8217;t save me from sorcery<br />
And didn&#8217;t let my soul be free</p>
<p>Mother, you&#8217;ve been telling me not to desire<br />
Mother, at that time I didn&#8217;t know where trouble lied<br />
Mother, you&#8217;ve been telling me that time is like water<br />
Mother, mother, mother, love is trouble</p>
<p>I will throw away my dream and crush it on the floor<br />
How you&#8217;ve broken my destiny and set it aside<br />
I will pour girl&#8217;s tears like rain</p>
<p>Mother, you&#8217;ve been telling me not to desire<br />
Mother, at that time I didn&#8217;t know where trouble lied<br />
Mother, you&#8217;ve been telling me that time is like water<br />
Mother, mother, mother, love is trouble</p>
<p>Mother, at that time I didn&#8217;t know where trouble lied<br />
Mother, you&#8217;ve been telling me that time is like water<br />
Mother, mother, mother, love is trouble<br />
