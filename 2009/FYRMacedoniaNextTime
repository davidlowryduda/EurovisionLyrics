Yeah yeah&#8230; but you are God-given<br />
The sweetest thing that will remain</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for you, I&#8217;d have no one<br />
To write a love song about<br />
If it weren&#8217;t for you, I&#8217;d have nothing<br />
To brag about to people</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for you, not a smile<br />
Would cover my lips<br />
If your voice doesn&#8217;t wake me up<br />
My whole day will be sad</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; these eyes<br />
Would watch you day or night<br />
Yeah yeah&#8230; on these lips<br />
I keep a smile only for you</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; in joy and sorrow<br />
Whatever happens will pass away<br />
Yeah yeah&#8230; but you are God-given<br />
The sweetest thing that will remain</p>
<p>There are beautiful things in life<br />
For those who know how to live<br />
There are hidden places in this world<br />
But you have to find them</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; these eyes<br />
Would watch you day or night<br />
Yeah yeah&#8230; on these lips<br />
I keep a smile only for you</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; in joy and sorrow<br />
Whatever happens will pass away<br />
Yeah yeah&#8230; but you are God-given<br />
The sweetest thing that will remain</p>
<p>I give you love to get something<br />
Something that will remain</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; in joy and sorrow<br />
Whatever happens will pass away<br />
Yeah yeah&#8230; but you are God-given<br />
The sweetest thing that will remain</p>
<p>Yeah yeah&#8230; in joy and sorrow<br />
Whatever happens will pass away<br />
Yeah yeah&#8230; but you are God-given<br />
The sweetest thing that will remain<br />
