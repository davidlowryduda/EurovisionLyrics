<p>I see it in your eyes, you wanna dance with me tonight<br />
It&#8217;s rainin&#8217; on your body as you&#8217;re puttin&#8217; up a fight<br />
The way you&#8217;re moving, how you groove is somewhere out of sight<br />
You know it&#8217;s only fair to tell you that you do it right</p>
<p>Now with a little luck, I&#8217;m gonna meet you on the dance floor<br />
Just by the way you move you make me beg for more<br />
I&#8217;m burning with desire, it&#8217;s the night I&#8217;ve waited for</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you lose your emotion<br />
Don&#8217;t you be shy tonight<br />
Let the rhythm show you<br />
Baby, you can do it right<br />
Alright tonight</p>
<p>Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way<br />
Take a chance with me, make my body sway<br />
It&#8217;s an overload in a disco fantasy<br />
Let&#8217;s dance the night away</p>
<p>Just yesterday we were on the floor<br />
Like somewhere in a movie or a club in Singapore<br />
The lights are bright, the mood is raw<br />
And in the middle of the night, we dance till we get sore</p>
<p>And in the middle of the night, I&#8217;ll meet you on the dancefloor<br />
Gonna make it, move your body, beg for more<br />
With a rhythm and a beat, I&#8217;ll rock you to the core</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you lose your emotion<br />
Don&#8217;t you be shy tonight<br />
Let the rhythm show you<br />
Baby, you can do it right<br />
Alright tonight</p>
<p>Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way<br />
Take a chance with me, make my body sway<br />
It&#8217;s an overload in a disco fantasy<br />
Let&#8217;s dance the night away</p>
<p>(Dance with me)<br />
(Dance, dance, dance with me)<br />
(Dance with me)</p>
<p>Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way<br />
Take a chance with me, make my body sway<br />
It&#8217;s an overload in a disco fantasy<br />
Let&#8217;s dance the night away</p>
<p>Come on, dance with me, make me lose my way<br />
Take a chance with me, make my body sway<br />
It&#8217;s an overload in a disco fantasy<br />
Let&#8217;s dance the night away</p>
