<p>I was wandering alone<br />
I was turning to stone<br />
I was going insane<br />
When you came into my life</p>
<p>You chased sorrow away<br />
You changed night into day<br />
You cured all of my pain<br />
With your eyes that never lie</p>
<p>All my life I waited<br />
Thinking I would never fly<br />
Then you looked and saw my wings<br />
With your eyes that never lie</p>
<p>You are my desert and well<br />
You are my heaven and hell<br />
You are my reason to be<br />
My love song, my battle cry</p>
<p>I know I will be whole<br />
While I keep in my soul<br />
The light shining on me<br />
From your eyes that never lie</p>
<p>All my life I waited<br />
Thinking I would never fly<br />
Then you looked and saw my wings<br />
With your eyes that never lie</p>
<p>Oh, my darling angel<br />
Guide me through despair in the sky<br />
If I&#8217;m lost I&#8217;ll see the way<br />
In your eyes that never lie</p>
