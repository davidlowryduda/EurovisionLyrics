<p>Everybody&#8217;s sayin&#8217; your love is like a prison<br />
Everybody&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to help me to come free<br />
Everybody&#8217;s talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout all the things I&#8217;m missin&#8217;<br />
And for all them reasons I must agree</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too dangerous when we touch<br />
And I love you much too much<br />
Get out of my life, babe</p>
<p>Just get out of my, out of my, out of my head<br />
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my bed<br />
It&#8217;s beyond belief, but true<br />
I became a slave to you</p>
<p>Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams<br />
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes<br />
Where I lose all of my drive<br />
While I&#8217;m fighting to survive</p>
<p>Just get out of my life<br />
Get out of my life</p>
<p>Well, you are like a moonbeam that makes me feel so lonely<br />
You are like a mountain and I&#8217;m afraid to fall<br />
Every time I&#8217;m certain you are my one and only<br />
I know if you leave me, I&#8217;ll lose it all</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause you&#8217;re overwhelming me<br />
You&#8217;re too perfect, can&#8217;t you see?<br />
Please, get out of my life</p>
<p>Just get out of my, out of my, out of my head<br />
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my bed<br />
It&#8217;s beyond belief, but true<br />
I became a slave to you</p>
<p>Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams<br />
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes<br />
Where I lose all of my drive<br />
While I&#8217;m fighting to survive<br />
Just get out of my life</p>
<p>Because I love you<br />
More than you will ever know<br />
Would be hard to let you go<br />
But get out of my life<br />
Get out of my life</p>
<p>It&#8217;s beyond belief, but true<br />
I became a slave to you</p>
<p>Just get out of my, out of my, out of my dreams<br />
Just get out of my, out of my, out of my scenes<br />
Where I lose all of my drive<br />
While I&#8217;m fighting to survive</p>
<p>Just get out of my life<br />
Get out of my way, hey&#8230;<br />
Or just stay</p>
