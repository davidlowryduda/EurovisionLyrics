<p>Always on my mind<br />
Always in my heart</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for you night after night<br />
Like a shadow staying close to the light<br />
Suddenly you stand beside me and I see<br />
A million burning stars, oh</p>
<p>You are always on my mind, always in my heart<br />
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high<br />
Always on my mind, always in my dreams<br />
I wanna hold you close to me, always all the time</p>
<p>I believe I&#8217;m addicted to you<br />
In your eyes I see dreams coming true<br />
Finally I have found you and now<br />
I will never let you go, no</p>
<p>You are always on my mind, always in my heart<br />
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high<br />
Always on my mind, always in my dreams<br />
I wanna hold you close to me, always all the time</p>
<p>Always on my mind, always in my heart<br />
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high<br />
Always on my mind, always in my dreams<br />
I wanna hold you close to me, always all the time</p>
<p>Always on my mind<br />
Always in my heart<br />
Always on my mind<br />
Always in my dreams<br />
Always all the time</p>
