I look again, your eyes are like a volcano<br />
You won&#8217;t escape, your fire will tell the truth<br />
It doesn&#8217;t matter if you want or not, because today I command</p>
<p><em>Come on and take me, come on and shake me</em><br />
I want to know what you feel about me<br />
<em>Come on and take me, come on and shake me</em><br />
Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m crazy about you?</p>
<p><em>Come set me free, just you and me</em><br />
The night is for me</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t go on any further, I swear you&#8217;ll be mine<br />
Come and dance, you&#8217;re no longer able to escape<br />
It doesn&#8217;t matter if you want or not, because today I command</p>
<p><em>Come on and take me, come on and shake me</em><br />
I want to know what you feel about me<br />
<em>Come on and take me, come on and shake me</em><br />
Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m crazy about you?</p>
<p><em>Come set me free, just you and me</em><br />
The night is for me</p>
<p>Ah&#8230;<br />
<em>Take me, shake me, take me</em></p>
<p>The light is shining, you are my magical night<br />
There are no taboos anymore, I want to nail you on my cross</p>
<p><em>Come on and take me, come on and shake me</em><br />
I want to know what you feel about me<br />
<em>Come on and take me, come on and shake me</em><br />
Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m crazy about you?</p>
<p>The night is for me<br />
The night is for me<br />
<em>Come set me free, just you and me</em><br />
The night is for me<br />
