<p>Years ago, when I was younger<br />
I kinda liked a girl I knew<br />
She was mine and we were sweethearts<br />
That was then, but then it&#8217;s true</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with a fairytale<br />
Even though it hurts<br />
&#8216;Cause I don&#8217;t care if I lose my mind<br />
I&#8217;m already cursed</p>
<p>Every day we started fighting<br />
Every night we fell in love<br />
No one else could make me sadder<br />
But no one else could lift me high above</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what I was doing<br />
When suddenly, we fell apart<br />
Nowadays, I cannot find her<br />
But when I do, we&#8217;ll get a brand new start</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in love with a fairytale<br />
Even though it hurts<br />
&#8216;Cause I don&#8217;t care if I lose my mind<br />
I&#8217;m already cursed</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a fairytale, yeah&#8230;<br />
Even though it hurts<br />
&#8216;Cause I don&#8217;t care if I lose my mind<br />
I&#8217;m already cursed</p>
