If it had to be done, I would stop the earth<br />
I would turn off the light so that you would stay asleep<br />
If it had to be done to please you, listening to you every night<br />
When you speak of love, I would speak of it too</p>
<p>So you still look into the depth of my eyes<br />
So you still see in there the greatest of great fires<br />
And so your hand clings to my skin where it wants to<br />
If you run away one day, I would follow if I could</p>
<p>And if it had to be done, I would repel the winter<br />
With hard blows of springtime and long clear mornings<br />
If it had to be done to please you, I would stop time<br />
So all your words of yesterday stay with me now</p>
<p>So I still look into the blue of your eyes<br />
So your two hands still get lost in my hair<br />
I will do everything bigger and if it&#8217;s too much or too little<br />
I would be wrong all the time, if that&#8217;s what you want</p>
<p>I do want to give everything, if only you believe in it<br />
My heart does want to bleed, if only you see it<br />
Until being nothing more but the shadow of your nights<br />
Until being nothing more but a shadow that follows you</p>
<p>And if it had to be done<br />
