I feel cold, deceitful shadows<br />
The desire sparked at the bottom<br />
A void in the soul becoming<br />
A taste of bitter, a taste of dark</p>
<p>We must come out of the shadows, intrigues and words<br />
Give your heart, don&#8217;t despair, and fly through the darkness</p>
<p>I also feel it, I am also afraid<br />
The dream is trembling with my fear<br />
Moments of loss, moments of fear<br />
When hopes roll in dust</p>
<p>We have to come out of the shadows, of intrigues and words<br />
Give your heart, don&#8217;t despair, and fly through the darkness<br />
We have to come out of the shadows, of intrigues and words<br />
Give your heart, don&#8217;t despair, and fly through the darkness</p>
<p>But where to?<br />
I don&#8217;t know, at this moment, every instance is a mistake<br />
Silence whispers in me: don&#8217;t stay alone</p>
<p>I also feel it, I am also afraid<br />
Don&#8217;t stay alone</p>
<p>As forgiveness approaches<br />
Clouds embrace the return<br />
Do not stray, you&#8217;re the same<br />
Even if someone breaks you</p>
<p>Lord, may Your voice lead us<br />
Through the darkness in us<br />
Give us a gift, work a wonder, return love<br />
Love, please</p>
<p>Love, please, may your voice lead us<br />
Through the darkness in us<br />
Give us a gift, work a wonder, stand by us</p>
<p>Love, please, may your voice lead us<br />
Through the darkness in us<br />
Give us a gift, work a wonder, stand by us<br />
Keep the love<br />
