<p>I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, falling down</p>
<p>I got this panic emotion that I can not describe to you<br />
My world is tumbling down what am I what am I gonna do<br />
Ca-can&#8217;t deny it, deny it what am I going through<br />
Ca-can not fight it, can&#8217;t fight it now I&#8217;m looking for the truth</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna live a lie, checking on my sanity<br />
Cos maybe baby I can do without, is it all a fantasy?<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna live a lie, is this my reality?<br />
It&#8217;s spinning round and round day and night</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
Never thought that I would be the one falling down<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
Never thought that I would be the one falling down</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on a critical mission, got my destiny in my hands<br />
Like peter piper I take control, put a spell on the mass<br />
I cause hysteria worry yourself that&#8217;s how I roll<br />
It&#8217;s not a drill, I&#8217;m for real, I&#8217;m a man who&#8217;s out of control</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna live a lie, checking on my sanity<br />
Cos maybe baby I can do without, is it all a fantasy?<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna live a lie, is this my reality?<br />
It&#8217;s spinning round and round day and night</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
Never thought that I would be the one falling down<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
Never thought that I would be the one falling down</p>
<p>I&#8217;m falling, I&#8217;m falling<br />
And I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
I&#8217;m falling, I&#8217;m falling down</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
Never thought that I would be the one falling down<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna lose control but I&#8217;m falling, I just can&#8217;t believe it<br />
Never thought that I would be the one falling down</p>
