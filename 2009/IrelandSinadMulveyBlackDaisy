<p>This time you&#8217;ve really gone too far<br />
So sick of hearing stories<br />
About the new girl hanging round<br />
You&#8217;re supposed to be with me</p>
<p>And when I heard the rumour<br />
You kissed her at a party<br />
Like a jealous fool I ran to you<br />
You were still mine</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the way my life goes<br />
Still love me, even she knows<br />
You say you&#8217;re sorry, but you&#8217;re not</p>
<p>Et cetera (Et cetera)<br />
I heard that old song many times<br />
But I still believe you really wanted her</p>
<p>I spent the day (I spent the day)<br />
Deciding should I go or stay<br />
Hoping that the pain would go away</p>
<p>Remember how astounding<br />
It felt to be around me<br />
Extravaganza in the heat<br />
And then the rain came pouring</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the way my life goes<br />
Still love me, even she knows<br />
You say you&#8217;re sorry, but you&#8217;re not</p>
<p>Et cetera (Et cetera)<br />
I heard that old song many times<br />
But I still believe you really wanted her</p>
<p>I spent the day (I spent the day)<br />

<p>That&#8217;s just the way my life goes<br />
