<p>My love for you grows with each passing day<br />
I&#8217;m by your side, when you&#8217;re away<br />
And when I miss you and long for your care<br />
I close my eyes and you&#8217;re there</p>
<p>All that I ask is one moment in time<br />
No strings attached, no drawing lines<br />
You feel my thoughts even when you&#8217;re not here<br />
I close my eyes, close my eyes and I feel you&#8217;re there</p>
<p>Take my love, take my heart<br />
Carry me with you in your dreams<br />
No no never let go, wonder of love, magical glow</p>
<p>Take my love, take my heart<br />
Carry me with you in your dreams<br />
No no never let go, wonder of love, magical glow</p>
<p>All that I ask is one moment in time<br />
No strings attached, no drawing lines<br />
You feel my thoughts even when you&#8217;re not here<br />
I close my eyes, close my eyes and I feel you&#8217;re there</p>
<p>Take my love, take my heart<br />
Carry me with you in your dreams<br />
No no never let go<br />
Wonder of love, magical glow</p>
<p>Search for me in your dreams<br />
Search for me, it&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll be</p>
<p>Take my love, take my heart<br />
Carry me with you in your dreams<br />
No no never let go, wonder of love, magical glow</p>
<p>Take my love, take my heart<br />
Carry me with you in your dreams<br />
No no never let go, wonder of love, magical glow</p>
