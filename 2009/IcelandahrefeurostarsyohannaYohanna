<p>You say you really know me<br />
You&#8217;re not afraid to show me what is in your eyes<br />
So tell me &#8217;bout the rumours<br />
Are they only rumours? Are they only lies?</p>
<p>Falling out of a perfect dream<br />
Coming out of the blue</p>
<p>Is it true? (Is it true?)<br />
Is it over? Did I throw it away?<br />
Was it you? (Was it you?)<br />
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?</p>
<p>If you really knew me, you couldn&#8217;t do this to me<br />
You would be my friend<br />
If one of us is lying, there&#8217;s no use in trying<br />
No need to pretend</p>
<p>Falling out of a perfect dream<br />
Coming out of the blue</p>
<p>Is it true? (Is it true?)<br />
Is it over? Did I throw it away?<br />
Was it you? (Was it you?)<br />
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?</p>
<p>Is it true? (Is it true?)<br />
Is it over? Did I throw it away?<br />
Was it you? (Was it you?)<br />
Did you tell me you would never leave me this way?</p>
<p>(Is it real? Did I dream it?)<br />
Will I wake from this pain?<br />
Is it true? (Is it true?)<br />
Is it over? Baby, did I throw it away?</p>
<p>Is it true?</p>
