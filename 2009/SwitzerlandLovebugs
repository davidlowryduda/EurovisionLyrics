<p>I climb a tree, so mighty high<br />
I see the world from just beneath the sky<br />
The dreams I dream, they take me high<br />
Oh, it&#8217;s always worth a try</p>
<p>The time is now, so stop the tease<br />
And may I have your attention, please<br />
The time has come, the curtains call</p>
<p>Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah<br />
From the highest heights of all? Oh yeah</p>
<p>I climb this tree, the highest heights<br />
From beneath the stars, I see little lights<br />
The dreams I dream demand their rights, oh</p>
<p>Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah<br />
From the highest heights of all? Oh yeah</p>
<p>How will I ever know?<br />
I&#8217;ve always gotta know<br />
Will you catch me?</p>
<p>Will you catch me when I fall? Oh yeah<br />
From the highest heights of all? Oh yeah<br />
Will you catch me?</p>
