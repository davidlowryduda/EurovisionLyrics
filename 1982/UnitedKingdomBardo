<p>One step further and I would&#8217;ve been there</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t seem to get your attention no matter how I try<br />
I just want you to prefer me to the other guys</p>
<p>So when you looked at me, you only turned away<br />
So I walked up beside you<br />
But I forgot all the things that I planned to say<br />
I don&#8217;t know if I tried to</p>
<p>I could have taken one step further and I would&#8217;ve been there<br />
You could have turned around and hit me and I wouldn&#8217;t have cared<br />
All this time I didn&#8217;t get anywhere<br />
I could have taken one step further and I would&#8217;ve been there</p>
<p>Ain&#8217;t got the courage to speak when you&#8217;re sometimes near<br />
Well I can&#8217;t seem to think of the things that a girl likes to hear</p>
<p>But when I saw you again, you were all alone<br />
So I walked up beside you<br />
But I was too shy to even ask you home<br />
I don&#8217;t know if I tried to</p>
<p>I could have taken one step further and I would&#8217;ve been there<br />
You could have turned around and hit me and I wouldn&#8217;t have cared<br />
All this time I didn&#8217;t get anywhere<br />
I could have taken one step further and I would&#8217;ve been there</p>
<p>If you read my letters or my telegrams<br />
You&#8217;d have got around to asking me just who I am<br />
&#8216;Cause you know I&#8217;m gonna get ya<br />
I&#8217;m gonna get ya, I&#8217;m gonna get ya</p>
<p>One step further and I would&#8217;ve been there<br />
You could have turned around and hit me and I wouldn&#8217;t have cared<br />
All this time I didn&#8217;t get anywhere<br />
I could have taken one step further and I would&#8217;ve been&#8230;</p>
<p>One step further and I would&#8217;ve been there<br />
You could have turned around and hit me and I wouldn&#8217;t have cared<br />
All this time I didn&#8217;t get anywhere</p>
<p>One step further and I would&#8217;ve been there<br />
You could have turned around and hit me and I wouldn&#8217;t have cared<br />
All this time I didn&#8217;t get anywhere<br />
I could have taken one step further and I would&#8217;ve been&#8230;</p>
<p>(One step further and I would&#8217;ve been there)<br />
I could have taken one step further<br />
(One step further and I would&#8217;ve been there)<br />
One step, one step</p>
