Hey, hey, hey, hey</p>
<p>One in the morning, a touch, a sparkle in your glance<br />
Two in the morning, two fingers of magic<br />
On the count of three, who knows where this will end?<br />
Four in the morning, I&#8217;m falling, a beautiful moonlight<br />
A drop too many and I&#8217;m slipping on the floor</p>
<p>One in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Two in the morning, very good<br />
Three o&#8217;clock already, hey, very good<br />
Four in the morning, very good</p>
<p>Five in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Six o&#8217;clock already, very good<br />
Seven in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Eight in the morning, very good</p>
<p>Breakfast for two<br />
Without knowing what&#8217;s coming next, very good</p>
<p>Five in the morning, I&#8217;m following my heart<br />
Half past six, striking of madness<br />
Seven in the morning, listening to an old record<br />
Today is the first day of the rest of your life<br />
Too many hours already and there&#8217;s no way out</p>
<p>One in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Two in the morning, very good<br />
Three o&#8217;clock already, hey, very good<br />
Four in the morning, very good</p>
<p>Five in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Six o&#8217;clock already, very good<br />
Seven in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Eight in the morning, very good</p>
<p>Breakfast for two<br />
Without knowing what&#8217;s coming next</p>
<p>One in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Two in the morning, very good<br />
Three o&#8217;clock already, hey, very good<br />
Four in the morning, very good</p>
<p>Five in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Six o&#8217;clock already, very good<br />
Seven in the morning, hey, very good<br />
Eight in the morning, very good</p>
<p>Breakfast for two<br />
Without knowing what&#8217;s coming next, very good<br />
Very good, hey<br />
