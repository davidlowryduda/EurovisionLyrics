<p>Hey baby, tell me please, how can you come back to me as cool as a breeze?<br />
You can fool some people with your big brown eyes<br />
But I&#8217;m the one who knows that you&#8217;ve been telling me lies<br />
You tell me that you love me so then you pack up and off you go</p>
<p>Here today, gone tomorrow, one day love, next day sorrow<br />
First you give, then you borrow, here today, gone tomorrow<br />
Baby, love me all of the time or I don&#8217;t really wanna know</p>
<p>Here today, gone tomorrow, one day love, next day sorrow<br />
First you give, then you borrow, here today, gone tomorrow<br />
Baby, give me all of your love or I don&#8217;t really wanna know</p>

<p>Hey baby, would it be nice if I paid attention to my friends&#8217; advice?<br />
They&#8217;ve been telling me that I should turn you down<br />
&#8216;Cause you&#8217;ve another girlfriend on the far side of town<br />
I always hoped when you&#8217;d go away<br />
That you would change your rovin&#8217; ways and come back to stay</p>
<p>Here today, gone tomorrow, one day love, next day sorrow<br />
First you give, then you borrow, here today, gone tomorrow<br />
Baby, love me all of the time or I don&#8217;t really wanna know</p>
<p>Here today, gone tomorrow, one day love, next day sorrow<br />
First you give, then you borrow, here today, gone tomorrow<br />
Baby, give me all of your love or I don&#8217;t really wanna know</p>
<p>Here today, gone tomorrow, one day love, next day sorrow<br />
First you give, then you borrow, here today, gone tomorrow</p>
