(Run after money) What could I do with the money?<br />
(Run without stopping) And how to catch time<br />
(If you want to win) If I don&#8217;t see it passing by?</p>

<p>Run without worrying (Without worrying)<br />
About the harm you do (About the harm you do)<br />
You must be mad (Be mad)<br />
To live on your knees</p>
<p>(Run from heart to heart) My heart isn&#8217;t strong enough<br />
(Run towards happiness) To beat records<br />
(There is too much love) And even if it&#8217;s a bit too big<br />
(To live one love) A single love will fit into it</p>
<p>(Run without worrying) I never knew hatred<br />

<p>(La lalalala&#8230; la lalalala&#8230;) Ah&#8230;<br />
(La lalalala&#8230; lalala lala&#8230;) Ah&#8230;<br />
(La lalalala&#8230; la lalalala&#8230;) Ah&#8230;<br />
