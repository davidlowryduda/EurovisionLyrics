Today is Sunday, a little Sunday<br />
A fine Sunday, it could be like this forever<br />
Every Sunday, the Sunday&#8217;s passing<br />
Like always, far too quickly</p>
<p>Every Sunday I&#8217;m alone<br />
At home on my little island<br />
And on Sunday I&#8217;m always feeling<br />
Like Friday and Robinson</p>
<p>On Sunday I need a little time for myself<br />
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch</p>
<p>Sunny Sunday or rainy Sunday<br />
On every Sunday I feel wonderful<br />
Because from Sunday-morning to Sunday-evening<br />
I&#8217;m lying in my four-poster bed</p>
<p>Every Sunday starts on Monday<br />
Is getting good on Wednesday and lasts then until Friday<br />
And Saturday is nearly Sunday<br />
And the party just begins</p>
<p>On Sunday I need a little time for myself<br />
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch</p>
<p>Sunday, I like Sundays<br />
The whole week long, I&#8217;m waiting for Sunday<br />
Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
And is giving me the right vibrations</p>
<p>Sunday, I like Sundays<br />
Every Sunday I&#8217;m already looking forward to the next<br />
Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
It has this special something</p>
<p>On Sunday I need a little time for myself<br />
Just a little rest, no rush, no watch</p>
<p>Sunday, I like Sundays<br />
The whole week long, I&#8217;m waiting for Sunday<br />
Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
And is giving me the right vibrations</p>
<p>Sunday, I like Sundays<br />
Every Sunday I&#8217;m already looking forward to the next<br />
Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
It has this special something</p>
<p>Sunday, I like Sundays<br />
The whole week long, I&#8217;m waiting for Sunday<br />
Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
And is giving me the right vibrations</p>
<p>Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
And is giving me the right vibrations<br />
Sunday, such a sunny day<br />
