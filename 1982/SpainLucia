Come, I&#8217;m free from eight to ten<br />
We can have fun and have a drink<br />
He&#8217;s like a faithful dog<br />
But I prefer you, though people say I&#8217;m crazy</p>
<p>He acts like a serious man<br />
You&#8217;re laughing about it<br />
He intends to be my owner<br />
You phone me and forget me<br />
But I prefer you</p>
<p>He forgives me because he&#8217;s a scrap of good bread<br />
And he treats me with patience<br />
I know that I shouldn&#8217;t be cruel<br />
That I should tell him I&#8217;m not interested in him</p>
<p>He acts like a serious man<br />
You&#8217;re laughing about it<br />
He intends to be my owner<br />
You phone me and forget me<br />
But I prefer you</p>
<p>He says that I will change<br />
That I have to find him when I settle down<br />
Come, I&#8217;m free from eight to ten<br />
Then I have to study and think about whom I&#8217;m interested in</p>

He intends to be my owner<br />
You phone me and forget me<br />
But I prefer you</p>
