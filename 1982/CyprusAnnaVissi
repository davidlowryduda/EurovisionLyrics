<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Nothing stays, nothing lives<br />
Everything is erased, vanished like the sun in the rain<br />
But above me, above you<br />
Above everything there&#8217;s</p>
<p>Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives at every instant<br />
Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives</p>
<p>What&#8217;s our life, little if you think about it<br />
You would close your eyes, you wouldn&#8217;t want to see<br />
But behind the mistakes, the human torture<br />
Above everything there&#8217;s</p>
<p>Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives at every instant<br />
Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives, and lives</p>
<p>Our life passes by, and whatever leaves, we&#8217;re in pain<br />
It doesn&#8217;t come back, but something holds us together</p>
<p>Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives at every instant<br />
Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives</p>
<p>Only love, only love<br />
Only love, and lives<br />
