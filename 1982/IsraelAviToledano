<p>Hora, Hora, Hora</p>
<p>The field we left back then still turns to gold<br />
The land still produces its harvest<br />
And the nights in Canaan are still beautiful<br />
Before the sun rises</p>
<p>A train still crosses a green orchard there<br />
A stork still relaxes above<br />
And the fog still carries in the valley<br />
Between the sunrise and the dew</p>
<p>And also the Hora, the one with the Hey<br />
Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced<br />
And also the Hora, the one with the Hey<br />
Its song fills my heart forever</p>
<p>Clouds still float over the city houses<br />
And the sea caresses the sand<br />
And still we hear how in the hearts there beats<br />
An old refrain and a dance</p>
<p>And also the Hora, the one with the Hey<br />
Its voice still rises, its voice has not been silenced<br />
And also the Hora, the one with the Hey<br />
Its song fills my heart forever</p>
<p>Lai lai lai lai&#8230; lala lai lai lai&#8230;<br />
Lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
Lai lai lai lai&#8230; lala lai lai lai&#8230;<br />
