Tell me, what does goodbye mean?<br />
Is it only sad, something that hurts you?<br />
Believe me, we can say goodbye<br />
Not like the last time, when I left you</p>
<p>I will always remember you as a friend<br />
If we never see each other again</p>
<p>We have our memories, they will never die<br />
Now the time has come, to say goodbye</p>
<p>Tell me, what does goodbye mean?<br />
Can it have any worth if all belongs to the past?<br />
Believe me, we will say goodbye<br />
Show love if we split up completely</p>
<p>I will always remember you as a friend<br />
If we never see each other again</p>
<p>We have our memories, they will never die<br />
Now the time has come, to say goodbye<br />
Goodbye<br />
