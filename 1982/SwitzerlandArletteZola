<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
We can cross the sea, fly around the earth<br />
Chase after adventure, look for gold<br />
We can leave our homeland, change our nose and our life<br />
But above all we need love</p>
<p>Love we love you, more than ourselves<br />
More than money, politics and songs<br />
And even though you chain us up<br />
Our heart beats like a butterfly&#8217;s wings</p>
<p>We can believe in fantasy, have eclectic tastes<br />
Think in terms of Rossini or Travolta<br />
We can go in for speed, yoga, business<br />
Without love there is something missing</p>
<p>Love we love you, in spite of ourselves<br />
You toss us to-and-fro like sailboats in the wind<br />
And even though we&#8217;re in your power<br />
We feel free and soar as seagulls</p>
<p>Love we love you, in spite of ourselves<br />
You carry us along like fish in the ocean<br />
However we like the way you lead us<br />
It is a bit crazy but we can&#8217;t live without you</p>
<p>Love we love you, more than ourselves<br />
More than money, politics and songs<br />
Love we love you, love we love you<br />
Our eyes are full of laughter and song<br />
Our heart beats like a butterfly&#8217;s wings<br />
