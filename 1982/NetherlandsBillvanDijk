Look, the swallows are back again<br />
They have finished their journey<br />
And the winter is on the run<br />
You&#8217;re coming back</p>
<p>Look, the pear tree behind our house<br />
Is in bloom again, stands bride again<br />
And my dreams are coming true<br />
You&#8217;re coming back</p>
<p>You and I<br />
Have found each other again<br />
We&#8217;ll be joined forever<br />
No matter what way we go</p>
<p>You and I<br />
Will always find each other<br />
To start over again<br />
It was written in the stars<br />
That we&#8217;ll go home together</p>
<p>Look, along every road stands a cross<br />
That&#8217;s the long way home<br />
You and I come home together<br />
You&#8217;re coming back</p>
<p>Look, the swallows high in the sky<br />
Have finished their journey<br />
Just like us no longer on the run<br />
You&#8217;re coming back</p>
<p>You and I<br />
Have found each other again<br />
We&#8217;ll be joined forever<br />
No matter what way we go</p>
<p>You and I<br />
Will always find each other<br />
To start over again<br />
It was written in the stars<br />
That we have to go home together</p>
<p>You and I<br />
Along those different roads<br />
We&#8217;ll meet each other again anyway<br />
There, where the pear tree is<br />
