Where are those who ran after me?<br />
Where are those who opened their hearts to me?<br />
Where are those who were so happy with my love?<br />
Where?</p>
<p>Where are those who smiled at me?<br />
Where are those who called me sweetheart?<br />
Where are those who waited for me?<br />
Where?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so unfortunate<br />
Not to be able to talk to anyone<br />
You try to say something<br />
And they just walk away</p>
<p>I saw you somewhere<br />
You walked away, again<br />
You ignored my love</p>
<p>I tried to come closer<br />
But you left me again<br />
I loved you so much, where?<br />
Where?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know how to love<br />
Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s so easy<br />
To use flattering words<br />
And win a heart</p>
<p>Where are those who used to run after me?<br />
Where are those who used to open their hearts to me?<br />
Where are those who where so happy with my love<br />
(Where? Where? Where?)</p>
<p>Where are those who smiled at me?<br />
Where are those who called me sweetheart?<br />
Where are those who waited for me?<br />
(Where? Where?)</p>
<p>Hey hey hey hey&#8230;<br />
Where are those who ran after me?<br />
Where are those who opened their hearts to me?<br />
Where are those who were so happy with my love?</p>
<p>Where?<br />
