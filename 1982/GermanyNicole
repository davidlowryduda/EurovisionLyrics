Just like a flower at the beginning of winter<br />
And just like a fire in an icy wind<br />
Just like a doll that nobody wants anymore<br />
That&#8217;s how I feel on some days</p>
<p>Then I see the clouds above<br />
And I hear the cries of the birds in the wind<br />
I sing my song in fear of the dark<br />
And hope that nothing happens</p>
<p>A bit of peace, a bit of sunshine<br />
For this earth on which we&#8217;re living<br />
A bit of peace, a bit of joy<br />
A bit of warmth, that&#8217;s what I wish for</p>
<p>A bit of peace, a bit of dreams<br />
And that people won&#8217;t cry as often<br />
A bit of peace, a bit of love<br />
May I never lose hope again</p>
<p>I know my songs won&#8217;t help very much<br />
I&#8217;m just a girl who says what she feels<br />
Alone I&#8217;m helpless, a bird in the wind<br />
That feels that the storm begins</p>
<p>A bit of peace, a bit of sunshine<br />
For this earth on which we&#8217;re living<br />
A bit of peace, a bit of joy<br />
A bit of warmth, that&#8217;s what I wish for</p>
<p>A bit of peace, a bit of dreams<br />
And that people won&#8217;t cry as often<br />
A bit of peace, a bit of love<br />
May I never lose hope again</p>
<p>Sing with me a little song<br />
(A bit of peace, a bit of sunshine)<br />
(For this earth on which we&#8217;re living)</p>
<p>May the world live in peace<br />
(A bit of peace, a bit of joy)<br />
(A bit of warmth, that&#8217;s what I wish for)</p>
<p>Sing with me a little song<br />
(A bit of peace, a bit of dreams)<br />
(And that people won&#8217;t cry as often)</p>
<p>May the world live in peace<br />
(A bit of peace, a bit of love)<br />
(May I never lose hope again)<br />
