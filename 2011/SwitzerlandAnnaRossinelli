<p>I looked into your eyes and when I saw your smile<br />
I knew right from the start: life is good for a while<br />
Romance comes and goes but a love like ours is here to stay<br />
Each lovely night and sunny day</p>
<p>I love everything about you, I couldn&#8217;t do without you<br />
Whenever you&#8217;re near me, all my days are on the bright side<br />
But when I&#8217;m not around you, I have to find the way<br />
To be with you each night and every day</p>
<p>Na nanana nanana&#8230; na nanana nanana&#8230;<br />
Na nanana nananana&#8230; na nananana&#8230;<br />
Na nanana nanana&#8230; na nanana nanana&#8230;<br />
Nanana nanana nanana&#8230;</p>
<p>And as time goes by and we&#8217;ve seen stormy weather<br />
I know that you and I, we&#8217;re always getting better<br />
But when I&#8217;m not around you, I have to find the way<br />
To be with you each night and every day</p>
<p>Oh, I couldn&#8217;t do without you, yeah<br />
I have to find the way to&#8230; to be with you, no oh no no oh&#8230;<br />
I love everything you do<br />
I have to find the way to be with you</p>
<p>I know you and I are in love for a while</p>
