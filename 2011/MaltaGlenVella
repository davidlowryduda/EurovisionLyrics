<p>Life&#8217;s a game, it&#8217;s a mystery which we give in to<br />
Days go by, no lesson learnt, just things that you do<br />
Things change even in my mind, not in my heart<br />
I am who I am and I&#8217;m here for you</p>
<p>One life &#8211; show what&#8217;s in your heart, love me like I love you<br />
One life is all we get to live, time to set your heart free<br />
Chase the pain away, move on and don&#8217;t give up<br />
This time it&#8217;s all up to you, you can love yourself too</p>
<p>Life is strange and heavenly once you surrender (Surrender)<br />
Love begins within ourselves and makes up our lives<br />
Hold on to what life brings you, just be who you are<br />
You can lead the way too, it&#8217;s all up to you</p>
<p>One life &#8211; show what&#8217;s in your heart, love me like I love you<br />
One life is we get to live, time to set your heart free<br />
Chase the pain away, move on and don&#8217;t give up<br />
This time it&#8217;s all up to you, you can love yourself too</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to judge me, you don&#8217;t know how I feel<br />
Love me, love me for who I am<br />
My life, I will give it all, I give it all to you, give it all</p>
<p>One life &#8211; show what&#8217;s in your heart, love me like I love you<br />
One life is all we get to live, time to set your heart free<br />
Chase the pain away, move on and don&#8217;t give up<br />
This time it&#8217;s all up to you, you can love yourself too</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all up to you, you can love yourself too<br />
It&#8217;s all up to you, you can love yourself too</p>
