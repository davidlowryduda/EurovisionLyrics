<p>Peter is smart, he knows each European country by heart<br />
He likes to sit under an apple tree on his yard<br />
And wait for an apple to fall</p>
<p>When Peter is nine, his teacher tells him that this planet is dying<br />
That someone needs to put an end to it all<br />
And so when Peter comes home, he tells his mom:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going out in the world to save our planet<br />
And I ain&#8217;t coming back until she&#8217;s saved<br />
I&#8217;ll walk my way to see the king and parliament<br />
If they don&#8217;t help, I&#8217;ll do it by myself<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna be&#8230;</p>
<p>Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam&#8230;</p>
<p>Peter is young, he tries to talk, but no one listens to him<br />
Everybody&#8217;s busy living and dying, not thinking about what they&#8217;re doing</p>
<p>But look at the boy who went out in the world to save our planet<br />
And he ain&#8217;t coming back until she&#8217;s saved<br />
He walked his way to see the king and parliament<br />
But they all turned their heads and walked away, singing:</p>
<p>Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam&#8230;<br />
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam&#8230;</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;m going out in the world to save our planet<br />
And I ain&#8217;t coming back until she&#8217;s saved<br />
I&#8217;m walking in the footsteps that young Peter made<br />
And everybody is welcome to join, and sing with me:</p>
<p>Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam&#8230;<br />
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam&#8230;<br />
Dadadam dadadam dadadada dadada dadam&#8230;</p>
