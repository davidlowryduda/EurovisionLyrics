Sometimes you find yourself depressed<br />
Sometimes you find yourself mistrusting<br />
Sometimes you find yourself startled<br />
Sometimes you find yourself in despair</p>
<p>Night or day, the fight is joy<br />
And the people move on by shouting in the street</p>
<p>Wearing a tight belt won&#8217;t help much<br />
To go complaining won&#8217;t help much<br />
Carrying a gloomy face won&#8217;t help much<br />
Anger won&#8217;t help you much</p>
<p>Night or day, the fight is joy<br />
And the people move on by shouting in the street</p>
<p>So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy<br />
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy<br />
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let&#8217;s sing against the reaction<br />
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let&#8217;s sing against the reaction</p>
<p>So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy<br />
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always someone warning you to be careful<br />
There&#8217;s always someone who wants to silence you<br />
There&#8217;s always someone that leaves you bitter<br />
There&#8217;s always someone to sell you your own air</p>
<p>Night or day, the fight is joy<br />
And the people move on by shouting in the street</p>
<p>So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy<br />
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy</p>
<p>Come celebrate this state of affairs and let&#8217;s sing against the reaction<br />
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let&#8217;s sing against the reaction<br />
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let&#8217;s sing against the reaction<br />
Come celebrate this state of affairs and let&#8217;s sing against the reaction</p>
<p>So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy<br />
So bring the bread and bring the cheese and bring the wine<br />
Here come the elderly and here come the youth and the little boy<br />
The fight will carry on<br />
