<p>And you came to me one night<br />
Like a morning light just to hold me tight<br />
Then you left and I was so alone<br />
Saying I should&#8217;ve known you&#8217;re no good for me</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason I should cry<br />
No, no baby, I&#8217;ll survive<br />
I don&#8217;t care, I don&#8217;t care</p>
<p>No one will ever hold you tight<br />
No one will ever love you like<br />
Just no one like I do<br />
There is no one, no one</p>
<p>No one will ever treat you right<br />
You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s never satisfied<br />
There is no one like I, like I am</p>
<p>I can feel what you&#8217;re looking for<br />
I&#8217;m not that girl no more, I&#8217;m not made of stone<br />
I&#8217;m gonna stand on my own<br />
Not gonna break me down, no one will stop me now<br />
No no no no&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause life is kind without you<br />
And I know I can make it through without you<br />
Without you</p>
<p>(Life goes all around) Round and round and round<br />
I feel love for sure (And it&#8217;s gonna get you)<br />
(Life goes all around) Spinning all around<br />
Now you want me, don&#8217;t you</p>
<p>No one will ever hold you tight (Hold you tight)<br />
No one will ever love you like (Love you like)<br />
Now you&#8217;re back, I can feel your love<br />
Oh yeah, I&#8217;m never gonna let you</p>
<p>No one will ever treat you right (Treat you right)<br />
You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s never satisfied (Satisfied)<br />
After all, you can fall<br />
Ad there&#8217;s no one you can reach to</p>
<p>No one will ever, ever love you<br />
No one will ever, ever touch you<br />
No one will ever, ever hold you<br />
Turn around now, just turn around now<br />
If you love me, yeah</p>
<p>No one like me, no one, no one</p>
