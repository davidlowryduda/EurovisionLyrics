<p>When I close my eyes, I fall into a dream<br />
Can&#8217;t you see this world, all people live in peace<br />
The sun is shining in my heart, rainbows in the sky<br />
Spread your wings and fly, fly, fly high</p>
<p>We all are dreamers on our way<br />
In a world where we&#8217;re not meant to stay<br />
Together we can make it all<br />
The secret is in you, it&#8217;s love</p>
<p>When I smile inside my heart, I feel so free<br />
All the fears and doubts, they turn into belief<br />
I feel alright, we&#8217;ll make it right now<br />
If we trust, trust, trust in love</p>
<p>We all are dreamers on our way<br />
In a world where we&#8217;re not meant to stay<br />
Together we can make it all, the secret is love </p>
<p>I&#8217;m reaching out my hand to you<br />
Soldiers let the light shine through<br />
So we can realise the wonder of life</p>
<p>(Trust, love, life)<br />
So what more do we need? (Trust, love, life)<br />
So what more will it take to see life?<br />
Just open your eyes</p>
<p>(We all are dreamers on our way)<br />
(In a world where we&#8217;re not meant to stay) We&#8217;re not meant to stay<br />
Together we can make it all, the secret is love</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reaching out my hand to you<br />
Soldiers let the light shine through<br />
(Soldiers let the light shine through)<br />
So we can realise the wonder of life</p>
<p>(Trust, love, life)<br />
(Spread your wings and fly)<br />
(Trust, love)</p>
<p>See the secret is love</p>
