<p>My days and nights are passing, long hours are running<br />
But we are still fighting – ay ay ay<br />
The love is still so shining, why are we denying?<br />
I really don&#8217;t know why – ay ay ay</p>
<p>Come and take my hand, now don&#8217;t be shy (Don&#8217;t be shy)<br />
And let&#8217;s try to hold our spirits high (Spirits high)</p>
<p>Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a<br />
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a<br />
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you</p>
<p>Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a<br />
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a<br />
I wanna say that one thing is true<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you</p>
<p>I know that love cannot lie, I wanna give you a new try<br />
So there&#8217;s no need to cry – ay ay ay<br />
And if you want, we can fly, high up to the sky<br />
Just you and I – ay ay ay ay</p>
<p>Come and take my hand, now don&#8217;t be shy<br />
And let&#8217;s try to hold our spirits high</p>
<p>Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a<br />
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a<br />
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you</p>
<p>Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a<br />
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a<br />
I wanna say that one thing is true<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you</p>
<p>You are the strongest fighter<br />
You&#8217;re the king for me (I&#8217;m in love with you)<br />
It&#8217;s time to win me in the ring of love, baby<br />
Baby, boom</p>
<p>Boom boom, chucka chucka, your kiss is like a, like a<br />
Boom boom, chucka chucka, your love is like a, like a<br />
I wanna say that one thing is true (True)<br />
I&#8217;m in love with you</p>
