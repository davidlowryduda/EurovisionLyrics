<p>Friday, my night<br />
Flashing street lights<br />
Let&#8217;s get this old town dancing<br />
Leave the troubles behind, oh&#8230; </p>
<p>Put your hands up<br />
Let the magic take over your heart<br />
Join us, you&#8217;ll have a good time<br />
Love is here to stay</p>
<p>Celebrate every single step you take<br />
Stop the world for a moment, shine like a comet<br />
Nothing can stop you now</p>
<p>Celebrate every single step you take<br />
Stop the world for a moment, shine like a comet<br />
In our musical galaxy</p>
<p>Friday, late night<br />
We&#8217;re all just shadows in the moonlight<br />
A thousand drums are beating<br />
Till the break of day </p>
<p>Put your hands up<br />
Let the magic take over your heart<br />
Join us, you&#8217;ll have a good time<br />
The party of your life</p>
<p>Celebrate every single step you take<br />
Stop the world for a moment, shine like a comet<br />
Nothing can stop you now</p>
<p>Celebrate every single step you take<br />
Stop the world for a moment, shine like a comet<br />
In our musical galaxy</p>
<p>Just keep movin&#8217; and dancin&#8217; and dancin&#8217; and dancin&#8217;<br />
Music will hear your soul<br />
Let&#8217;s move to the rhythms and beats all around<br />
Until we lose control</p>
<p>Celebrate every single step you take<br />
Stop the world for a moment, shine like a comet<br />
Nothing can stop you now</p>
<p>Celebrate every single step you take<br />
Stop the world for a moment, shine like a comet<br />
In our musical galaxy</p>
<p>Celebrate</p>
