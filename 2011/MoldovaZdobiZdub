<p>So lucky, so lucky</p>
<p>Flashes, Ray-Ban glasses<br />
I move with ease in my convertible breeze (So lucky)<br />
Martini, whiskey on the rocks<br />
Life on the top, my party never stops (So lucky)</p>
<p>Winner, a dusk to dawn sinner<br />
Love traded in for lust, it&#8217;s emotions I don&#8217;t trust (So lucky)<br />
On top, the cream of the crop<br />
You know I love to rock, the fun will never stop (So lucky)</p>
<p>You see, it&#8217;s all about me<br />
The servants and the king, I&#8217;m the ruler of the world (So lucky)<br />
A tug, she pulls me like a drug<br />
I want her on the rug, but she&#8217;s not that kind of girl (So lucky)</p>
<p>I see you where the lights glow<br />
You pull me in your private side show<br />
And now I see your moves in slo-mo<br />
I try to kiss you, but you slip away</p>
<p>Yet you never walk away from me<br />
Are you a shadow of what might be?<br />
Why should one woman stand above the rest?<br />
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh</p>
<p>(So lucky, so lucky, so lucky, so lucky)</p>
<p>Those eyes pulling me in, a body made to sin<br />
But I can not win (So lucky)<br />
Wait, I&#8217;m ready at the gate, don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s too late<br />
Her fire starts to melt my heart (So lucky)</p>
<p>She&#8217;s clean, not part of any scene<br />
She&#8217;s more like a dream I don&#8217;t want to wake up from (So lucky)<br />
I see, she&#8217;s somehow changing me<br />
She&#8217;s where I want to be, can&#8217;t stand a moment without her (So lucky)<br />
Anymore</p>
<p>I see you where the lights glow<br />
You pull me in your private side show<br />
And now I see your moves in slo-mo<br />
I try to kiss you, but you slip away</p>
<p>Yet you never walk away from me<br />
Are you a shadow of what might be?<br />
Why should one woman stand above the rest?<br />
There is a mystery to you deep beneath the flesh</p>
<p>So lucky!</p>
