<p>You say you&#8217;re on it, but you just don&#8217;t know<br />
You&#8217;re spending money like you&#8217;re on death row<br />
You must be mis-educated by all the guys that you dated<br />
You think I&#8217;ll take the bait, but I don&#8217;t think so</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; am I headed for a car crash?<br />
Oh&#8230; I&#8217;m just about to meet my match, she takes the<br />
Oh&#8230; I&#8217;m about to fall in, head first<br />
Sisters, let me tell you how it works, hey!</p>
<p>She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, here I come, da da dum<br />
She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, hit and run, then I&#8217;m gone<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>You look at me and I got you in mind<br />
I come on over, see what I could find<br />
No appetite for delusion, I could&#8217;ve been what Iâ€™m losin&#8217;<br />
You&#8217;re saying yes when it is no, no, no, no</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; am I headed for a car crash?<br />
Oh&#8230; I&#8217;m just about to meet my match, she takes the<br />
Oh&#8230; I&#8217;m about to fall in, head first<br />
Sisters, let me tell you how it works, hey!</p>
<p>She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, here I come, da da dum<br />
She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, hit and run, then I&#8217;m gone<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey</p>
<p>She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, here I come, da da dum<br />
She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, hit and run, then I&#8217;m gone<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t wanna play (play, play)<br />
And then I didn&#8217;t look your way (way, way)<br />
It&#8217;s not like every girl&#8217;s the same (same, same)<br />
You gotta know just how to treat this, miss<br />
Or she will be dismissed, hey&#8230;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, here I come, da da dum<br />
She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, hit and run, then I&#8217;m gone<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey</p>
<p>She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, here I come, da da dum<br />
She&#8217;s got her lipstick on, hit and run, then I&#8217;m gone<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey<br />
Check my collar, collar, hey, hey-ey</p>
<p>Here I come, here I come<br />
Dum da dum, da dum, da dum&#8230;<br />
Here I come, here I come<br />
Dum da dum, da dum, da dum&#8230;</p>
<p>Hit and run, hit and run<br />
Dum da dum, da dum, da dum&#8230;<br />
Then I&#8217;m gone, then I&#8217;m gone<br />
Gone, gone, gone, gone</p>
