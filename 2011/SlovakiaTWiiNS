<p>Now nothing can touch me, I&#8217;ve seen what I can be<br />
Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire, but I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Now nothing can touch me, I&#8217;ve seen what I can be) I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire)</p>
<p>Would you climb up a mountain? Would you battle the ocean?<br />
Would you give this to lose it all?<br />
I believe in my life and try to learn every lesson<br />
Now I see why I fight and I fall</p>
<p>When the road&#8217;s not too wide (Not too wide)<br />
Then trust the heart never lies (Heart never lies)</p>
<p>Now nothing can touch me, I&#8217;ve seen what I can be<br />
Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire, but I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Now nothing can touch me, I&#8217;ve seen what I can be) I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire)</p>
<p>If you lost all meaning, no more truth to believe in<br />
Would the light inside fade to grey?<br />
But if you shine like a diamond, don&#8217;t get caught in the moment<br />
Never letting your breath slip away</p>
<p>When the road&#8217;s not too wide (Not too wide)<br />
Then trust the heart never lies (Heart never lies)</p>
<p>Now nothing can touch me, I&#8217;ve seen what I can be<br />
Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire, but I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Now nothing can touch me, I&#8217;ve seen what I can be) I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire)</p>
<p>(Now nothing can touch me) Nothing can touch me<br />
(I&#8217;ve seen what I can be) No no no no no<br />
(Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire) I&#8217;m still alive</p>
<p>(Now nothing can touch me) I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(I&#8217;ve seen what I can be) I feel alive<br />
(Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire)</p>
<p>(Now nothing can touch me) I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(I&#8217;ve seen what I can be) I&#8217;m still alive<br />
(Lonely I&#8217;ve walked through the fire) But I&#8217;m still alive</p>
