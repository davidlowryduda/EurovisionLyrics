Freezing winter and damn ice everywhere<br />
I&#8217;ve really had a rough day<br />
People are strange, no one follows the rules<br />
I&#8217;m dragging myself home, tired</p>
<p>And while I&#8217;m digging through my purse to find the key<br />
Losing my nerve already<br />
My sun, my moon and all the stars<br />
My man opens the door<br />
My man is at the door</p>
<p>And at the same moment I&#8217;m worth a thousand women<br />
Because to him I&#8217;m beautiful and strong as a rock<br />
And when he holds me, I know everything is fine<br />
The man is magical</p>
<p>He colours all of my darknesses into spring<br />
Ever since he loves me, I stand tall<br />
And for him, I&#8217;m good, just the way I am<br />
The man is magical</p>
<p>Farewell to sorrow and hello to my smile<br />
Happiness moved in with him<br />
So warm, gentle and wonderfully himself<br />
He belongs to me only</p>
<p>Long talks, he&#8217;s my best friend<br />
With him, I&#8217;m laughing like crazy<br />
People tell me they haven&#8217;t seen a couple shining like that<br />
Our love is contagious</p>
<p>Now I know that I&#8217;m worth a thousand women<br />
Because to him, I&#8217;m beautiful and strong as a rock<br />
And when he holds me, I know everything is fine<br />
The man is magical</p>
<p>He colours all of my darknesses into spring<br />
Ever since he loves me, I stand tall<br />
And for him, I&#8217;m good, just the way I am<br />
The man is magical</p>
<p>Now I know (That I&#8217;m worth a thousand women)<br />
(And when he holds me, I know everything is fine)<br />
The man is magical</p>
<p>He colours all of my darknesses into spring<br />
Ever since he loves me, I stand tall<br />
And for him, I&#8217;m good, just the way I am<br />
The man is magical<br />
