<p>Awake your heart<br />
You fear it, but we&#8217;ll make a start<br />
Seems like the wind just blows your way<br />
With clouds full of rain</p>
<p>And you hide, because the world ain&#8217;t right<br />
Know that your cold and hurtin&#8217; soul<br />
Is never alone</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t waste your time, just lift your mind<br />
Imagination comes alive<br />
Now you know that I&#8217;ll be by your side</p>
<p>Feel the risin&#8217; hope and the sky will open<br />
Take my hand, don&#8217;t stall, have faith<br />
Though the road is long, there are golden gardens<br />
At the sweet end of your trail</p>
<p>Lay down now<br />
I&#8217;ll ease your heart, erase your frown<br />
To light up the darkness in your dreams<br />
I will be here</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll find the freedom you left behind<br />
Capture the sun, the source, it shone<br />
You were never alone</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t waste your time, just lift your mind<br />
Imagination comes alive<br />
Now you know that I&#8217;ll be by your side</p>
<p>Feel the risin&#8217; hope and the sky will open<br />
Take my hand, don&#8217;t stall, have faith<br />
Though the road is long, there are golden gardens<br />
At the sweet end of your trail</p>
<p>Though the road is long, there are golden gardens<br />
At the sweet end of your trail<br />
At the sweet end of your trail</p>
