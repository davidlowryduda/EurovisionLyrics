Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
And now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>I pinch myself every day, thinking how lucky I am<br />
I&#8217;m not dreaming, it&#8217;s reality<br />
I live on cloud number nine, I have what I&#8217;ve never had<br />
I&#8217;ve got you, you, and everything you give me</p>
<p>And though I very well know that storms may come and I will fall<br />
I know at the end of the day, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the good times I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had<br />
Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>Each moment with you, that feeling is sublime<br />
I will not fear what is to come<br />
I won&#8217;t take precautions, nor will I carry any cross<br />
I&#8217;d rather enjoy watching you as you are</p>
<p>And though I very well know that storms may come and I will fall<br />
I know at the end of the day, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the good times I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had<br />
Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>I feel so good, I feel so good<br />
That I will never ever ever think negatively</p>
<p>And I very well know that storms will come and I will fall<br />
But at the end of the day, I&#8217;ve already enjoyed the good times I&#8217;ve had</p>
<p>Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had<br />
Whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230; whoa whoa whoa whoa&#8230;<br />
Now nobody can take away, take away the good times I&#8217;ve had<br />
