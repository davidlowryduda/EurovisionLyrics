<p>(With love) Hey&#8230; with love<br />
(With love, love, love) You gotta do it with love, love<br />
(With love)</p>
<p>In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
I&#8217;m doing everything and I&#8217;m doing it all (With love)<br />
In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
With love, baby, you can have it all</p>
<p>If you like to move it, if you like to groove it<br />
Do it with love, baby<br />
If you like to sing it, if you like to swing it<br />
Do it with love, baby</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause when your love is gone and you&#8217;re all alone<br />
There is nothing left to carry on<br />
So whenever we&#8217;re singing this song<br />
We do it with love, baby, with love</p>
<p>In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
I&#8217;m doing everything and I&#8217;m doing it all (With love)<br />
In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
With love, baby, you can have it all</p>
<p>(With love) With love, baby<br />
(With love) With love, baby<br />
(With love) With love, baby<br />
Oh, whatever you&#8217;re doing, just do it with love</p>
<p>You gotta do it with love, with love<br />
Come on and sing it, swing it with love<br />
Feel it in your body, your soul and your mind<br />
When you move, when you groove, with love</p>
<p>Break it down now<br />
One, two&#8230; bring the bass back</p>
<p>Yes, I had to sing it and I came to bring it to you<br />
With love, baby<br />
Then I tried to blend it, but I have to end it for you<br />
With love, baby</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause when I love you and you love me too<br />
There is nothing left for us to do<br />
But to hug and to kiss and to tug into bliss<br />
With love, baby, with love</p>
<p>In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
I&#8217;m doing everything and I&#8217;m doing it all (With love)<br />
In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
With love, baby, you can have it all</p>
<p>(With love) With love, baby<br />
(With love) With love, baby<br />
(With love) With love, baby<br />
Oh, whatever you&#8217;re doing, just do it with love</p>
<p>In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
I&#8217;m doing everything and I&#8217;m doing it all<br />
In my mind, my body and my soul<br />
With love, baby, you can have it all</p>
<p>With love, baby<br />
(With love) With love, baby<br />
(With love) With love, baby<br />
Oh, whatever you&#8217;re doing, just do it&#8230;<br />
With love</p>
