Here I am, here I am</p>
<p>Here I am &#8211; in your words, thoughts, every gesture<br />
Here I am &#8211; like water, earth, fire and air<br />
Here I am &#8211; in my arms you&#8217;re melting like ice</p>
<p>You&#8217;re waiting for at least a smile, a word<br />
Every day you&#8217;re trying to win me over again<br />
I got used to you</p>
<p>And when I have some problem<br />
You&#8217;re the first to stand at my door<br />
Now I&#8217;m finally sure<br />
That it&#8217;s you sending me flowers every day</p>
<p>I&#8217;m your inspiration, your remedy for tears<br />
(Your world revolves around me)<br />
You&#8217;re my shadow at my command<br />
(Appearing right beside me, jumping in the fire when I want you to)</p>
<p>I can feel anxiety taking over you, again and again<br />
I&#8217;m uncovering you like a pack of cards, little by little<br />
By your side, I lose my restraints</p>
<p>And when the night puts us to sleep<br />
My thoughts rush towards your eyes, your lips<br />
Just to make sure that still, after all</p>
<p>I&#8217;m your inspiration, your remedy for tears<br />
(Your world revolves around me)<br />
You&#8217;re my shadow at my command<br />
(Appearing right beside me)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m your inspiration, your remedy for tears<br />
(Your world revolves around me)<br />
You&#8217;re my shadow at my command<br />
(Appearing right beside me, jumping in the fire when I want you to)</p>
<p>Here I am</p>
<p>I&#8217;m your inspiration, your remedy for tears<br />
(Your world revolves around me)<br />
You&#8217;re my shadow at my command<br />
(Appearing right beside me)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m your inspiration, your remedy for tears<br />
(Your world revolves around me)<br />
You&#8217;re my shadow at my command<br />
(Appearing right beside me)</p>
<p>Right beside me<br />
