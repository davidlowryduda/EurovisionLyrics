<p>After the day I met you there I am not the same<br />
I try to sleep but nothing helps me feel insane<br />
Passion game that I play gonna last one more day<br />
One more night I&#8217;ll be there in my dreams again and again</p>
<p>I wanna give it on fire, uncover vicious desire<br />
Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay<br />
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare<br />
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I&#8217;m ready to pay</p>
<p>Pay for the hopeless despair<br />
Gonna live one more day of my fate</p>
<p>Here I am standing with my determination<br />
I remember when I used to be one of those silly fellows, kind of &#8220;really don&#8217;t care&#8221;<br />
And I realized all my thoughts and all my fears around me<br />
You wanted to know what I felt and you got it right there</p>
<p>Turn around, all the words of regrets<br />
And seize the chance to find the way so I can be raised<br />
I am too lame, psycho from the brain<br />
There is nothing I can do, that&#8217;s a part of the game</p>
<p>Out of such foolish state gonna find no other way<br />
(Make way, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s all about the shame)<br />
Feel no shame, &#8217;cause I live one more day again</p>
<p>I wanna give it to fire, uncover vicious desire<br />
Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay<br />
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare<br />
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I&#8217;m ready to pay</p>
<p>Pay for the hopeless despair<br />
(Turn back in the days when you desired and craved)<br />
(And all the way you felt just like burned in the flame)<br />
Gonna live one more day of my fate<br />
(No shame, no way, no play, no brain, no game)</p>
<p>I wanna give it to fire, uncover vicious desire<br />
Abandon painful denial, find every reason to stay<br />
One more forbidden sensation, one more emotional flare<br />
Down with the fake hesitation, hell yeah, I&#8217;m ready to pay</p>
<p>Pay for the hopeless despair<br />
Gonna live one more day of my fate</p>
