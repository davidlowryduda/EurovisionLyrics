I dream of those lips<br />
Of this clear and pure voice<br />
I never stopped thinking of you<br />
That night, near you</p>
<p>I dream, but I complain<br />
And my heart, indifferent<br />
To the life that awaits me tomorrow<br />
I&#8217;m kneeling in front of the sea</p>
<p>I was ready to share the world with you<br />
But you, you wanted to leave<br />
You shout victory<br />
Even far away, I still think that<br />
You&#8217;re still around me, I dream of you</p>
<p>I will sing, sing to you<br />
The song of you and me</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so bad that I cry<br />
I will pray the sky until I die<br />
There in the heights, I will confront you<br />
To wake up from this dream</p>
<p>If you die, take me<br />
