<p>Here&#8217;s your favourite song on the radio<br />
Shake your head to the beat, it&#8217;s rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll<br />
If you&#8217;re feeling the world has kicked you down<br />
All you need is just to have a little fun</p>
<p>Hey&#8230; it&#8217;s time to live it up<br />
My friend, put the record on<br />
Sing it loud and let it out, life is beautiful<br />
My friend, let it out, life is beautiful</p>
<p>Give yourself a break, come on and live it up<br />
Give yourself a break, come on and live it up<br />
Give yourself a break</p>
<p>Driving on with no map to lead me on<br />
Eyes on the horizon and there&#8217;s no turning round<br />
Sometimes I feel, I feel I&#8217;m not alone<br />
So let your colours shine right next to mine</p>
<p>Hey&#8230; it&#8217;s time to live it up<br />
My friend, put the record on<br />
Sing it loud and let it out, life is beautiful<br />
My friend, let it out, life is beautiful</p>
<p>Give yourself a break, come on and live it up<br />
Give yourself a break, come on and live it up<br />
Give yourself a break</p>
<p>I say my friend, life is beautiful<br />
I say my friend, life is beautiful<br />
I say my friend, put the record on<br />
Sing it loud and let it out, life is beautiful<br />
My friend, let it out, life is beautiful</p>
<p>Give yourself a break, come on and live it up<br />
Give yourself a break, come on and live it up<br />
Give yourself a break</p>
