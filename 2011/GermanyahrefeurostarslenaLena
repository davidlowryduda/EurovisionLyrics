<p>She&#8217;s got knuckle in her eye<br />
He knows her cat call<br />
Can&#8217;t escape from telling lies<br />
I heard her saying</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, mind if I take this chair?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Hey, mind if I take this chair?&#8221;<br />
He drops a pause, she looks annoyed<br />
But she&#8217;s so mean he thinks she has to be the one</p>
<p>Taken by a stranger<br />
Stranger things are starting to begin<br />
Lured into the danger<br />
Trip me up and spin me round again</p>
<p>You got some coffee on your collar<br />
And you forgot to comb your hair<br />
But I can wait till I do better<br />
You&#8217;re here and I don&#8217;t care</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help it if you like it &#8217;cause I won&#8217;t be here tomorrow<br />
No one ever told you that you wouldn&#8217;t be rejected</p>
<p>Taken by a stranger<br />
Stranger things are starting to begin<br />
Lured into the danger (Danger is a risky business)<br />
Trip me up and spin me round again</p>
<p>Dip dip dada dada da<br />
Ooh&#8230; l-la, l-la, l-la, l-la</p>
<p>Put the blindfold on his eyes<br />
She saw him peek through<br />
Can&#8217;t imagine her disguise<br />
I heard her saying</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, mind if I take this chair?&#8221;<br />
Yeah, see if I care</p>
<p>Taken by a stranger<br />
Stranger things are starting to begin<br />
Lured into the danger (Danger is a risky business)<br />
Trip me up and spin me round again</p>
