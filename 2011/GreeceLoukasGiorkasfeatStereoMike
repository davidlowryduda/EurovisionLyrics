<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I was born so betrayed, who am I? What I&#8217;ll be?<br />
What is mine in this life? Just the heaven and sea<br />
No I won&#8217;t give them up, they&#8217;re my fortune, my proof<br />
Don&#8217;t believe what you hear, &#8217;cause their truth kills your truth</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>The duty I&#8217;ve got is my war against fear<br />
And I want you with me, yes, I want you so near<br />
Watch my dance, head up high, hands like wings and I&#8217;ll fly</em></font><br />
Head up high and open arms</p>
<p>My soul has the fire<br />
That burns all fears individually<br />
I&#8217;m making steps toward God<br />
And if I ever fall, I&#8217;ll get up again</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I have heard many words but I still won&#8217;t forget<br />
The language of my body, the sound my heart makes<br />
So I&#8217;m staying alive and my losses won&#8217;t let<br />
My soul to surrender, the power of loss is my bet</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Watch my dance, head up high, hands like wings and I&#8217;ll fly</em></font><br />
Head up high and open arms</p>
<p>My soul has the fire<br />
That burns all fears individually<br />
I&#8217;m making steps toward God<br />
And if I ever fall, I&#8217;ll get up again</p>
<p>My soul has the fire<br />
That burns all fears individually<br />
I&#8217;m making steps toward God<br />
And if I ever fall, I&#8217;ll get up again<br />
