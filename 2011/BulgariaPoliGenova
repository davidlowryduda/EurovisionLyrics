I know I&#8217;ll find the strength inside me<br />
As much as I can achieve, yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t break everything inside of me<br />
They won&#8217;t see me broken again<br />
There is no way they will get to me, yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t find the way to me<br />
They won&#8217;t take away my belief<br />
They want to look over me again, no no&#8230;</p>
<p>But I know I&#8217;ll find the strength inside<br />
And reach the sky, for spite, for spite<br />
Oh yes, I know the power will be with me<br />
As much as I can achieve, as much as I can achieve</p>
<p>There is so much love inside me<br />
There is still a point in staying<br />
And we find the will every day, yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>There are people like you and me<br />
We will stay â€“ for spite we fight on<br />
Who does it depend on? Yes, on you and me, yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>But I know you&#8217;ll find the strength inside me<br />
And we will reach the sky, for spite, for spite<br />
Oh yes, I know the power will be with you<br />
As much as we can achieve, as much as we can achieve</p>

The strength and courage to go on</p>
<p>But I know I&#8217;ll find the strength inside<br />
And we will reach the sky, for spite, we are here again<br />
Oh, yes, I know the power will be with you<br />
As much as we can achieve, as much as we can achieve</p>

To fight with you, and you know<br />
As much as we can achieve<br />
Yes, we can achieve<br />
