<p>Hey yeah yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Hey yeah yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Hey yeah yeah yeah&#8230;<br />
Hey yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling great and it&#8217;s easy to be strong<br />
When all the hearts keep on beating as one<br />
The sky is blue and I&#8217;m writing a new song<br />
Saying that I&#8217;m free, friendly and young</p>
<p>I have so much and I&#8217;m ready to show you<br />
Let&#8217;s come together, so here is my hand<br />
We&#8217;re gonna fly watching lakes in their full view<br />
Fields are full of gold, and it&#8217;s all my land</p>
<p>I love Belarus, got it deep inside<br />
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind<br />
And I wanna see the sun shining from above<br />
You will always be the one, I can&#8217;t get enough</p>
<p>I love Belarus, got it deep inside<br />
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind<br />
And I wanna see the sun shining from above<br />
And I&#8217;m gonna every day give you all my love</p>
<p>So here I go and I&#8217;m ready to rise up<br />
Just like a star guiding me through the night<br />
I&#8217;ve got no fear and I will never give up<br />
Love is all we need and it&#8217;s our light</p>
<p>I love Belarus, got it deep inside<br />
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind<br />
And I wanna see the sun shining from above<br />
You will always be the one, I can&#8217;t get enough</p>
<p>I love Belarus, got it deep inside<br />
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind<br />
And I wanna see the sun shining from above<br />
And I&#8217;m gonna every day give you all my love</p>
<p>Time will not erase courage and my grace<br />
I&#8217;m stronger every day, I say&#8230;<br />
(I love Belarus, I love Belarus)<br />
You will always be the one, I can&#8217;t get enough</p>
<p>I love Belarus, got it deep inside<br />
I love Belarus, feel it in my mind<br />
And I wanna see the sun shining from above<br />
And I&#8217;m gonna every day give you all my love</p>
<p>I love Belarus</p>
