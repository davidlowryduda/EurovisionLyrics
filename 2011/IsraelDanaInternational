<p>And maybe the better days<br />
Have arrived here, just a short moment<br />
And everything will change from now on<br />
And we&#8217;ll love, we&#8217;ll love</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And if you have a dream of your own<br />
Don&#8217;t be afraid to go on with your heart<br />
Close your eyes and hear the bells of your soul</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Ding dong, say no more<br />
I hear silent prayers, and it&#8217;s making me high and fly<br />
I know where to go and I&#8217;m coming now</em></font></p>
<p>And maybe it&#8217;s almost, it&#8217;s close<br />
Now comes the turn of the good moment<br />
The pain in the heart turns and goes, leaves</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0"><em>Ding dong, say no more<br />
I hear silent prayers, and it&#8217;s making me high and fly<br />
I know where to go and I&#8217;m coming now</em></font></p>
<p>Praise the day that brings you the night<br />
Praise the time that will light you<br />
It will bring you redemption</p>
<p>Praise the day that brings you the night<br />
Praise the time that will light you<br />
And bring you redemption</p>
