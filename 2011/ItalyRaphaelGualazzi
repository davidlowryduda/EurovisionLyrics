Saying yes, saying never is not easy, you know<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>And all the world around you seems to slip and disappear</em></font><br />
I no longer know who you are, I don&#8217;t care who you are<br />
<font color="#C0C0C0"><em>I know for certain I won&#8217;t bother you with</em></font> nostalgia</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll see another me in a fragile dream<br />
You&#8217;ll laugh as if I had never loved you<br />
You&#8217;ll look for another me beyond the shadow of a coffee<br />
You&#8217;ll only find me<br />
If I stop for a moment, I no longer know who you are</p>
<p>Here we live like this, <font color="#C0C0C0"><em>day by day, night by night<br />
But someone hit me and I fell into your heart, my dear<br />
And you&#8217;ll fly over lands where your eyes can&#8217;t find the end<br />
Up on mountains, down lakes<br />
Being so far away from you just makes me feel so dead</em></font></p>
<p>And you will see another you, almost invincible<br />
Alive as ever and it is there where you will have me<br />
The horizon will be beyond false magic<br />
You&#8217;ll shine, you&#8217;ll shine, you&#8217;ll shine, you&#8217;ll shine<br />
