<p>When you look into my eyes<br />
World becomes a better place<br />
And you know deep inside<br />
Love is taking all the space<br />
Baby, I love you&#8230; and you?</p>
<p>We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down<br />
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless<br />
We are people of the planet, we live human lives<br />
We are angels, we&#8217;re in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white</p>
<p>When you look into my eyes<br />
Sun is touching mountain top<br />
When you look into my eyes<br />
It will never have to stop<br />
Baby, I love you&#8230; and you?</p>
<p>We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down<br />
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless<br />
We are people of the planet, we live human lives<br />
We are angels, we&#8217;re in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white</p>
<p>We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down<br />
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless<br />
We are people of the planet, we live human lives<br />
We are angels, we&#8217;re in danger, we are crystal white</p>
<p>We are birds, we fly so high and we are falling down<br />
When I dream of you, my dream is so fearless<br />
We are people of the planet, we live human lives<br />
We are angels, we&#8217;re in danger, we are crystal white, crystal white</p>
