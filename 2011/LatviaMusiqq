<p>Woke up tonight, looked at the moon<br />
Blinding light filled up my room<br />
Looked to my right &#8211; my better half<br />
And it&#8217;s alright, if it&#8217;s all I have<br />
I let it ride, I&#8217;m satisfied, just be mine</p>
<p>Kill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips<br />
Stare at me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs<br />
Kill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips<br />
Stare at me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs<br />
Angel in disguise</p>
<p>Angel in disguise, angel</p>
<p>Not a day goes by, not without you<br />
Crossing my mind, if you only knew<br />
Keep hope alive, I have faith in you<br />
Two worlds collide, honest and true<br />
You&#8217;re my lullaby, passion for life, my starlit night</p>
<p>Kill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips<br />
Stare at me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs<br />
Kill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips<br />
Stare at me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs<br />
Angel in disguise</p>
<p>Angel in disguise<br />
Ooh angel</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, like you and I<br />
Just spread your wings and learn to fly<br />
I must be one lucky guy<br />
With a girl like you right by my side</p>
<p>No sweat, am I doing this right?<br />
Bring the moon to the moonless sky<br />
Yeah, I see &#8211; the stakes are high<br />
But this story ends with no goodbye</p>
<p>Girl, I&#8217;m qualified<br />
I get what I see, no need to try<br />
I&#8217;ll make sure your dreams will never die</p>
<p>Kill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips<br />
Stare at me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs<br />
Kill me with killer kiss, kill me with tempting lips<br />
Stare at me with candy eyes, love me with luscious thighs<br />
Angel in disguise</p>
<p>Angel in disguise<br />
I said spread your wings and fly, spread your wings and fly<br />
Angel in disguise, ooh angel in disguise<br />
Spread your wings and fly</p>
