<p>(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)<br />
(Ge-ge-ge-get back up again)</p>
<p>You were the eyes in the face of fortune <br />
I lost my way and I couldn&#8217;t find you, oh&#8230; oh no<br />
We&#8217;re not the first ones to be divided<br />
 Won&#8217;t be the last to be reunited, oh&#8230; oh no</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like rain fallin&#8217; down <br />
Drops of pain hit the ground<br />
 I can&#8217;t speak, there&#8217;s no sound when you&#8217;re gone<br />
 (Yeah, yeah, come on)</p>
<p>I can, I will <br />
I know I can untie these hands <br />
Ge-ge-ge-get back up again</p>
<p> I can, I will <br />
I know I can untie these hands <br />
Ge-ge-ge-get back up again</p>
<p>I can, oh<br />
I can  (Get back up again)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never lost anything quite like this <br />
No second chances if I don&#8217;t find it , no, oh no, no<br />
You closed the door and you kept on walkin&#8217;<br />
 Left me behind and there&#8217;s no more talkin&#8217;, nNo, oh no (Oh no)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like rain fallin&#8217; down<br />
 Drops of pain hit the ground<br />
 I can&#8217;t speak, there&#8217;s no sound when you&#8217;re gone </p>
<p>I can, I will <br />
I know I can untie these hands<br />
 Ge-ge-ge-get back up again </p>
<p>I can, I will<br />
 I know I can untie these hands<br />
 Ge-ge-ge-get back up again<br />
(Come on)</p>
<p>I can, oh<br />
I can  (Get back up again)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not the first ones to be divided, oh <br />
Won&#8217;t be the last to be reunited, no<br />
(Come again, one more time)  When you&#8217;re gone<br />
(Come on)</p>
<p>I can, I will<br />
 I know I can untie these hands<br />
 Ge-ge-ge-get back up again</p>
<p> I can, I will <br />
I know I can untie these hands<br />
 Ge-ge-ge-get back up again</p>
<p>I can, I can<br />
Ge-ge-ge-get back up again</p>
