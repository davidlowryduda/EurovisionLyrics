Sometimes inside of me<br />
I felt an emptiness that<br />
Was calling me inside of it<br />
Come now to see the truth<br />
There is a bridge on the immensity</p>
<p>What am I really?<br />
God&#8217;s fragile dream<br />
With a body made this way<br />
Big eyes, color, living we die<br />
Renewed for eternity</p>
<p>Fly, fly, the strength will arrive<br />
Always from one freedom to another<br />
The new butterfly always leaves behind<br />
The chrysalis that you were<br />
Empty without me</p>
<p>From the clouds we know<br />
Then the rain will fall<br />
Suddenly it will happen<br />
The wings were wet with tears that won&#8217;t dry<br />
Then the wind will come</p>
<p>And you fly, fly, fly away from yourself<br />
Always alone until a reflection appears<br />
In the mirror that steals the image<br />
In a thousand pieces of vertigo<br />
The light will spark</p>
<p>How much life there is<br />
I never realized it<br />
And if you still don&#8217;t know<br />
The universe is ours</p>
<p>Fly, the strength will arrive<br />
Never be alone in the true freedom<br />
The new butterfly always leaves behind<br />
The chrysalis that you were<br />
Empty without me</p>
<p>Fly, in the joy you<br />
Will never be alone in the immensity of us<br />
In an instant love<br />
Like a new sun<br />
Will change everything</p>
<p>Fly, fly, fly with me<br />
