I set out on that long journey<br />
I walked on lost and restless<br />
I didn&#8217;t think of anything, not until the next day<br />
I chose peace and tranquility</p>
<p>I have a life, I have a life, I drift over every hardship<br />
I have a life, I have a life because of you<br />
When the winds blow against me, I climb over high mountains<br />
I have a life, I have a life, I have a life</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t understand the love that touches all<br />
I didn&#8217;t dare to embrace and exist<br />
I felt that I didn&#8217;t deserve to open my mind<br />
And let the bright love inside</p>
<p>I have a life, I have a life, I drift over every hardship<br />
I have a life, I have a life because of you<br />
When the winds blow against me, I climb over high mountains<br />
I have a life, I have a life, I have a life</p>
<p>And I believe it, yes, I believe it<br />
Maybe the beautiful doors of heaven will open<br />
The most beautiful love will overflow<br />
It will embrace me alone</p>
<p>I have a life&#8230; I drift over every hardship<br />
I have a life, I have a life because of you<br />
When the winds blow against me, I climb over high mountains<br />
I have a life, I have a life, I have a life</p>
<p>I have a life, I have a life, I have a life<br />
