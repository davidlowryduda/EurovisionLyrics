<p>Whoa&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
Whoa&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>His name is Jeremy, working in IT<br />
Never questions why he has always been<br />
An extra careful guy, sensitive and shy<br />
Risk assessment is his investment in a life of no surprise<br />
Till she walked into his life</p>
<p>She&#8217;s spontaneous indeed, uncertainty&#8217;s her creed<br />
She has always been neither black or white<br />
Just a curious delight<br />
She threw affection his direction, a collection of her smiles<br />
And to his surprise, whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play<br />
Like tomorrow she is always one day away<br />
All the time she slips away it&#8217;s close but yet so far<br />
It&#8217;s time to follow her tomorrow, whoa&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
Time to follow her tomorrow, whoa&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>He fell for her too fast, we all thought it wouldn&#8217;t last<br />
&#8216;Cause good ol&#8217; Jeremy likes his rigorous routine<br />
&#8216;Cause he only thinks today but tomorrow is a way<br />
To find a new direction and you&#8217;ll be okay</p>
<p>She&#8217;s like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play<br />
Like tomorrow she is always one day away<br />
All the time she slips away it&#8217;s close but yet so far<br />
It&#8217;s time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>Time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
Time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
Time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s like tomorrow, oh so distant, she just wants to play<br />
Like tomorrow she is always one day away<br />
One day away (One day away)<br />
One day away (One day away)</p>
<p>All the time she slips away it&#8217;s close but yet so far<br />
It&#8217;s time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s time to follow her tomorrow, oh&#8230; oh&#8230;</p>
