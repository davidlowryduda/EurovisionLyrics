Love, love doesn&#8217;t exist they say<br />
They lie, you can&#8217;t be afraid when he&#8217;s here<br />
Love is for your whole life and ever after<br />
It will be with me, know that</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll ask you for years<br />
When he cheats on you with a thousand strangers<br />
You heart becomes fish food, know that</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like crazy<br />
I want it a little, I won&#8217;t believe a little<br />
Because I don&#8217;t know everything</p>
<p>That love is everywhere<br />
I love a little, I don&#8217;t love a little<br />
I would try everything with him</p>
<p>You dream, you dream the world in blue<br />
You dream because he&#8217;s yours</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t listen to his lies any more<br />
When he kisses you, tell him to go away</p>
<p>I&#8217;m like crazy<br />
I want it a little, I won&#8217;t believe a little<br />
Because I don&#8217;t know everything</p>
<p>That love is everywhere<br />
I love a little, I don&#8217;t love a little<br />
I would try everything with him</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be waiting for him every night till morning comes<br />
He will make you coffee while you&#8217;re still in bed<br />
Believe me, believe me sister, I&#8217;m doing you a favor<br />
La lala lala lala lala</p>
<p>Yeah I&#8217;m like crazy<br />
That love is everywhere</p>
<p>That love is everywhere<br />
I love a little, I don&#8217;t love a little<br />
I would try everything with him<br />
And maybe something else<br />
