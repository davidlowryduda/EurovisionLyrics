<p>The rain stops again at night<br />
Trying the steal a smile from his lips<br />
How much the silence says and how much it hides<br />
How much truth left between all the wondering</p>
<p>Only for him could the cold be forgotten<br />
And because I find the light in the darkness<br />
Only for him will I cross the borders<br />
Only for him will I know the answers to questions</p>
<p>Only for him could the cold be forgotten<br />
And because I find the light in the darkness<br />
Only for him will I cross the borders<br />
Only for him will I know the answers to questions</p>
<p>At days I&#8217;ll keep a warm and enveloping glance<br />
Still trying quietly to caress his face<br />
How many tears have fallen and how many are left<br />
How many hopes were promised and how many were broken</p>
<p>Only for him could the cold be forgotten<br />
And because I find the light in the darkness<br />
Only for him will I cross the borders<br />
Only for him will I know the answers to questions</p>
<p>(At days I&#8217;ll keep a warm and enveloping glance)<br />
Still trying quietly to caress his face</p>
<p>Only for him could the cold be forgotten<br />
And because I find the light in the darkness<br />
Only for him will I cross the borders<br />
Only for him will I know the answers to questions</p>
<p>Only for him could the cold be forgotten<br />
And because I find the light in the darkness<br />
Only for him will I cross the borders<br />
Only for him will I know the answers to questions<br />
