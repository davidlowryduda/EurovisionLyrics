<p>Love is so bright<br />
Like a diamond in the light<br />
Love is so, so true<br />
I can paint my world in blue</p>
<p>Love is so deep<br />
And it makes my life complete<br />
Like a mountain in the sky<br />
Love is high, so high</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my life and I know it&#8217;s not forever<br />
It&#8217;s my life and I&#8217;ll share it all with you<br />
It&#8217;s my life, we were meant to be together<br />
I&#8217;ll give my life to you</p>
<p>Love is so strong<br />
In the heart where you belong<br />
It&#8217;s a dream, a desire<br />
And is burning like a fire</p>
<p>Love is so deep<br />
And it makes my life complete<br />
Like a mountain in the sky<br />
Love is high, so high</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my life and I know it&#8217;s not forever<br />
It&#8217;s my life and I&#8217;ll share it all with you<br />
It&#8217;s my life, we were meant to be together<br />
I&#8217;ll give my life to you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll find my story and fight for my glory of love</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my life and I know it&#8217;s not forever<br />
It&#8217;s my life and I&#8217;ll share it all with you<br />
It&#8217;s my life, we were meant to be together<br />
I&#8217;ll give my life to you</p>
