<p>Friday night was just going nowhere<br />
Sitting in a small caf√©<br />
Feeling lonely, a little tired<br />
I&#8217;ve been working hard all day</p>
<p>Then a noise caught all my attention<br />
And I heard a wonderful sound<br />
Coming at me like a tsunami<br />
Nearly took my feet off the ground</p>
<p>A rush of excitement flowed into my ears<br />
Oh, beautiful people, aha-ia-ia-ia-ia</p>
<p>Solayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya<br />
We play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha<br />
Solayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it&#8217;s gonna getcha<br />
We play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night</p>
<p>Situation started improving<br />
Maybe this was kismet now<br />
And my body just started moving<br />
I was really shaking down</p>
<p>Something happened when I was dancing<br />
I could feel that powerful beat<br />
Taking me to new dimensions<br />
Waking up the devil in me</p>
<p>A heavenly chorus and love all around<br />
Oh. beautiful people, aha-ia-ia-ia-ia</p>
<p>Solayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya<br />
We play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha<br />
Solayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it&#8217;s gonna getcha<br />
We play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night</p>
<p>(Cha-cha)<br />
(A hot night)</p>
<p>It feels like I&#8217;m dreaming, this word makes no sense<br />
Lets sing it again now, aha</p>
<p>Solayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya<br />
We play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha<br />
Solayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it&#8217;s gonna getcha<br />
We play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night</p>
<p>Solayoh, solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya<br />
We play-o, we play-o to the rhythm of a cha-cha<br />
Solayoh, solayoh, turn the music up, it&#8217;s gonna getcha<br />
We play-o, we play-o, we can make it on a hot night<br />
We can make it into a cha-cha</p>
