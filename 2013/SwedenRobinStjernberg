<p>Hey, do you remember<br />
How we would stay up all night<br />
Talking about our destiny</p>
<p>And I played the piano<br />
And you would strum on your guitar<br />
Those were the days</p>
<p>If only you could see me now<br />
I live my dream, I owe it all to you<br />
I owe it to you</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it crazy, yeah isn&#8217;t it crazy<br />
It&#8217;s all because of you<br />
All because of you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all because of you, oh<br />
All because of you, oh<br />
I know that if the sky would fall I&#8217;d survive it all<br />
Because of you, oh</p>
<p>I reach for the horizon<br />
Whenever I&#8217;ve got days of doubt<br />
Bringing me down</p>
<p>So even if disaster strikes<br />
I close my eyes and then I&#8217;m next to you<br />
I´m right there with you, hey</p>
<p>Yeah isn&#8217;t it crazy, isn&#8217;t it crazy<br />
It´s all because of you<br />
All because of you</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all because of you, oh<br />
All because of you, oh<br />
I know that if the sky would fall I&#8217;d survive it all<br />
Because of you, oh</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all &#8217;cause of you<br />
Because of you (Hey-ey, hey-ey)<br />
Because of you (Hey-ey)<br />
It&#8217;s all &#8217;cause of you</p>
<p>I know that if the sky would fall I&#8217;d survive it all<br />
Because of you, oh</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all because of you, oh<br />
All because of you, oh<br />
I know that if the sky would fall I&#8217;d survive it all<br />
Becuase of you, oh<br />
(Hey-ey, hey-ey, hey-ey)</p>
