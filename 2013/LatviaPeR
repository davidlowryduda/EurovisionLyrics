<p>Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly<br />
Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I need a starlight<br />
&#8216;Cause never have I had a day without a fight<br />
I slide through the darkness, it took me to a height<br />
Of a lonesome, cold and a never ending night</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the man on the moon, call me Andy Kaufman<br />
There are demons inside me but I&#8217;m-ma stomp &#8216;em<br />
I, I know I can be an unstoppable force<br />
I try, man, let me take a walk on the bright side</p>
<p>Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly<br />
Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly</p>
<p>A lot of thoughts in my head keep pulling me down<br />
So many guests in my house I couldn&#8217;t notice the sound<br />
Of the doorbell telling they&#8217;re about to come<br />
I&#8217;m surrounded by problems, I got to run</p>
<p>(But no) I keep pulling myself up<br />
(But no) I keep pulling myself up<br />
I&#8217;m on a mission to fulfil my vision<br />
All day, everyday, never ever, ever give up</p>
<p>Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly</p>
<p>Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly<br />
Here we go, here we go<br />
So alive, in the sky we can fly</p>
