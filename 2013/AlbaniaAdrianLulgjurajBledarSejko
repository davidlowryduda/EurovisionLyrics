Hey, hey<br />
Hey, hey</p>
<p>I have come from far away<br />
Under the dust of time I found clouds and curse<br />
I was standing too close and I touched only flame and fire<br />
I spoke only in silence but wanted some life, glory<br />
And when I shared the dream I found</p>
<p>A ray of light, a little breath like you<br />
A ray of light, a little breath like you</p>
<p>Coming from far away<br />
You&#8217;re thirsty and you&#8217;re craving when you see everything changes<br />
Life itself runs by, you&#8217;re searching in this language<br />
It&#8217;s the place where you were born, raised, you shared bravery<br />
And you gave love through the years</p>
<p>You ran, found freedom<br />
You ran, found freedom</p>
<p>This land has raised us<br />
We will speak only one language so there will be no tears<br />
You will be found anywhere in the world, you will be a stranger no longer<br />
Let it be a new beginning together in a brotherhood<br />
Because when I shared the dream I found</p>
<p>A ray of light, a little breath like you<br />
You ran, found freedom<br />
A ray of light, a little breath like you<br />
You ran, found freedom</p>
<p>A ray of light, a little breath like you<br />
You ran, found freedom<br />
A ray of light, a little breath like you<br />
You ran, found freedom<br />
