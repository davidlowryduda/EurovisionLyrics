<p>When the times are getting rough gold and silver turn to dust<br />
People build their barricades out of jealousy and hate<br />
But there&#8217;s one thing they could never, never ever separate</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; let it hear from near and far<br />
This is how it&#8217;s meant to be, we&#8217;re together you and me<br />
Ah&#8230; nothing can tear us apart<br />
Sailing on a stormy sea, we&#8217;re together you and me</p>
<p>We build castles with our hands, on a solid ground they stand<br />
They&#8217;re our shelter from the storm, to keep us safe and keep us warm<br />
No, there&#8217;s nothing that can hurt us, whatever there may come</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; let it hear from near and far<br />
This is how it&#8217;s meant to be, we&#8217;re together you and me<br />
Ah&#8230; nothing can tear us apart<br />
Sailing on a stormy sea, we&#8217;re together you and me</p>
<p>Time is flowing to the sea but it&#8217;s still you and me<br />
Nothing&#8217;s like it used to be, but we&#8217;re here, you and me</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; let it hear from near and far<br />
This is how it&#8217;s meant to be, we&#8217;re together you and me<br />
Ah&#8230; nothing can tear us apart<br />
Sailing on a stormy sea, we&#8217;re together you and me</p>
<p>Ah&#8230; nothing can tear us apart<br />
Sailing on a stormy sea, we&#8217;re together you and me</p>
