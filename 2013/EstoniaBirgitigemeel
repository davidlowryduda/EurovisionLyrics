<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I still remember when my soul settled<br />
That feeling so overwhelming and yet<br />
I&#8217;m standing on the road searching my heart<br />
Battered by the wind</p>
<p>But I know, I know that things can get better<br />
Every door that closes eventually opens again</p>
<p>The snow will melt and the bare trees will blossom<br />
Every ending is just a new beginning<br />
We need the night, the day can bring us light<br />
So there could be a new beginning, let bygones be bygones<br />
So there could be a new beginning once again</p>
<p>The curtain is raised again and the second act is starting<br />
Where I pick myself up and dust myself down<br />
However the new game will be changed more towards my fate<br />
I&#8217;m taking a different path</p>
<p>But I know, I know that things can get better<br />
Every door that closes eventually opens again</p>
<p>The snow will melt and the bare trees will blossom<br />
Every ending is just a new beginning<br />
We need the night, the day can bring us light<br />
So there could be a new beginning, let bygones be bygones</p>
<p>The snow will melt and the bare trees will blossom<br />
Every ending is just a new beginning<br />
We need the night, the day can bring us light<br />
So there could be a new beginning, let bygones be bygones<br />
So there could be a new beginning once again<br />
