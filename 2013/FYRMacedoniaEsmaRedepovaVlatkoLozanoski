It&#8217;s not like before<br />
The good times are gone<br />
In the good or in the bad<br />
We were living</p>
<p>Before the dawn<br />
Be next to me<br />
In the new day<br />
Me and you to be together</p>
<p>Before the dawn<br />
Stay next to me<br />
Now it&#8217;s the time<br />
For beautiful days<br />
Stay next to me</p>
<p>Me, Esma, singing to you<br />
Will warm your hearts<br />
Me, Esma, singing to you<br />
Will warm your hearts</p>
<p>So, shake your hips<br />
Come on now, get up all gypsies</p>
<p>If you come back<br />
The good times will come back too<br />
Either joy or sorrow<br />
We will share together</p>
<p>Before the dawn<br />
Stay next to me<br />
Now it&#8217;s the time<br />
For beautiful days<br />
Stay next to me</p>
<p>Me, Esma, singing to you<br />
Will warm your hearts<br />
Me, Esma, singing to you<br />
Will warm your hearts</p>
<p>So, shake your hips<br />
Come on now, get up all gypsies</p>
<p>Before the dawn<br />
Stay next to me<br />
Now it&#8217;s the time<br />
For beautiful days<br />
Stay next to me<br />
