<p>Who&#8217;s the one that starts a war?<br />
Who&#8217;s dictating what is less and more?<br />
Who can change the night and day?</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s the one with clever face?<br />
That can tell us what is in the space?<br />
Playing games that none can play</p>
<p>Maybe someday we&#8217;ll break the wall<br />
Maybe the light will touch us all</p>
<p>Lonely planet, who has done it?<br />
Who can save you? Who can stop it?<br />
Lonely planet, who has done it?<br />
Who can save you? Who can stop it?</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s the one that has the right?<br />
Treat us wrong and tell us what is right?<br />
Bringing crowd against the squad</p>
<p>Who has honesty to show?<br />
Who can tell us &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;?<br />
Who&#8217;s the man and who&#8217;s the god?</p>
<p>Maybe someday we&#8217;ll break the wall<br />
Maybe the light will touch us all</p>
<p>Lonely planet, who has done it?<br />
Who can save you? Who can stop it?<br />
Lonely planet, who has done it?<br />
Who can save you? Who can stop it?</p>
<p>Lonely planet, we have done it<br />
We can save you, we can stop it<br />
Lonely planet, we have done it<br />
We can save you, we can stop it</p>
<p>We can stop it, we can stop it<br />
We can stop it, we can stop it<br />
For the world </p>
