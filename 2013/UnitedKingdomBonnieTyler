<p>You say you don&#8217;t believe in signs from up above<br />
And you laugh at the thought of putting your faith in stuff like love<br />
You never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain, you say<br />
You wanna believe but it&#8217;s just not worth the pain today</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all fine if that&#8217;s how you want it to be<br />
But if you&#8217;re feeling alone and afraid and you can&#8217;t breathe</p>
<p>Believe in me, yeah<br />
Believe in me, yeah</p>
<p>Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you<br />
The way I speak the truth, I&#8217;d never lie to you<br />
If you&#8217;d just believe in the things that your eyes can&#8217;t see<br />
Believe in me</p>
<p>You come and you go and there&#8217;s never no compromise, that&#8217;s why<br />
The seconds and the minutes of your life go crawling by</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s all fine if that&#8217;s how you want it to be<br />
But if you&#8217;re feeling alone and afraid and you can&#8217;t breathe</p>
<p>Believe in me, yeah<br />
Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you<br />
The way I speak the truth, I&#8217;d never lie to you<br />
If you&#8217;d just believe in the things that your eyes can&#8217;t see<br />
Believe in me</p>
<p>What ya gonna do when your ship is sinking?<br />
And you&#8217;re crying out for help and just the seagulls listening<br />
In the dark of the night, in the middle of the fight<br />
When you&#8217;re reaching out for something and there&#8217;s nothing</p>
<p>Believe in me, yeah<br />
Believe in the way I look at you and stand beside you<br />
The way I speak the truth, I&#8217;d never lie to you<br />
If you&#8217;d just believe in the things that your eyes can&#8217;t see<br />
Believe in me</p>
