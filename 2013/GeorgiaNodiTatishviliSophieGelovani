<p>There&#8217;s no me without you<br />
Don&#8217;t know what I would do<br />
You&#8217;re my heartbeat, I&#8217;m breathing because of you</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no world without us<br />
Dreams would turn into dust<br />
You&#8217;re the reason, the reason I make it through</p>
<p>Feels like I&#8217;m flying, like if I had wings<br />
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams<br />
Your love is pouring down on me<br />
You&#8217;re my waterfall</p>
<p>In a moment like this<br />
I&#8217;m in a state of bliss<br />
I&#8217;m swept away, I look into an open sky</p>
<p>Feels like I&#8217;m flying, like if I had wings<br />
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams<br />
Your love is pouring down on me<br />
You&#8217;re my waterfall</p>
<p>My heart is higher than the highest kite<br />
I feel how all your love surrounds me<br />
Standing in the waterfall</p>
<p>(Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams)<br />
Sailing on a sea of dreams<br />
(Your love is pouring down on me)<br />
You&#8217;re my waterfall</p>
<p>Feels like I&#8217;m flying, like if I had wings<br />
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams<br />
Your love is pouring down on me<br />
You&#8217;re my waterfall</p>
