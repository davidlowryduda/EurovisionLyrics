(I&#8217;ll take you to the party, to-to-to-to the party)<br />
(Ty-ty-ty-ty the party, I&#8217;ll take you to the party)<br />
(I&#8217;ll take you to the party, to-to-to-to the party)<br />
(Ty-ty-ty-ty the party, I&#8217;ll take you to the party)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a party, it doesn&#8217;t stop<br />
Beat after beat, verse after verse<br />
The whole world is shaking for it<br />
One move and the universe goes</p>
<p>Come on take me, set me free<br />
From this awful stress throughout the year<br />
I can&#8217;t take the paranoia any more<br />
At the party everything smells good</p>
<p>The party will never stop out here<br />
On the podium alone or next to the bar<br />
When the sun comes up we&#8217;re still here, not a moment to lose<br />
Nothing is a fuss, just get on with it</p>
<p>The beat and the bass are so catchy<br />
No one will leave with money in their pockets<br />
Tomorrow we will hang out again<br />
With my people no one thinks about money</p>
<p>Let it last all night and all day<br />
And there&#8217;ll be more, even better, believe me<br />
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;re made for it<br />
I&#8217;ll take you, I&#8217;ll take you, follow me</p>
<p>Come with me now<br />
This is the night<br />
It ain&#8217;t gonna end<br />
(I&#8217;ll take you to the party)</p>
<p>I need a party that won&#8217;t stop<br />
Until the hot girl is shaking her body<br />
It&#8217;s hot like an oven set to two hundred degrees<br />
Losing our minds, strobes flashing</p>
<p>The beat goes crazy in my head<br />
My pocket is burning, pour me a drink<br />
Grill, garlic, parsley, fish<br />
Give it all to me so I can binge</p>
<p>Take me somewhere to cool down<br />
Where the music rocks so hard<br />
And doesn&#8217;t stop but just keeps pumping<br />
All night long and everyone is here with me</p>
<p>The heat is on, struggling to make it<br />
Take me somewhere so I don&#8217;t crack<br />
Open a can, life is a miracle<br />
Let&#8217;s go to the party, where else can we?</p>
<p>Let it last all night and all day<br />
And there&#8217;ll be more, even better, believe me<br />
&#8216;Cause we&#8217;re made for it<br />
I&#8217;ll take you, I&#8217;ll take you, follow me</p>
<p>Come with me now<br />
This is the night<br />
It ain&#8217;t gonna end<br />
(I&#8217;ll take you to the party)</p>
<p>Just let us hear the beat<br />
Everyone are friends here<br />
And it doesn&#8217;t matter if<br />
Everyone has a thin wallet</p>
<p>Just let us hear the beat<br />
Everyone are friends here<br />
The drill will always spin<br />
But the money doesn&#8217;t</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll take you to the party, to-to-to-to the party)<br />
(Ty-ty-ty-ty the party, I&#8217;ll take you to the party)<br />
(I&#8217;ll take you to the party, to-to-to-to the party)<br />
(Ty-ty-ty-ty the party, I&#8217;ll take you to the party)<br />
