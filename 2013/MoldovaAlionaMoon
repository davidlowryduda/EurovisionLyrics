A thousand sunsets lost in the sea, lost within us<br />
A thousand sun rays used to bring morning light on our eyelashes<br />
A thousand shooting stars captured our gaze<br />
A thousand secular nights vanished away in the skies, but we stood by</p>
<p>Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born<br />
But we only see clouds<br />
We built up memories for ourselves<br />
Which we then destroyed</p>
<p>Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born<br />
But we only see clouds<br />
We built up memories for ourselves<br />
Which we then destroyed</p>
<p>A thousand tears can&#8217;t wash away the pain of losing you<br />
For a thousand nights, the silence swallows me<br />
It wants me to forget you, it&#8217;s asking too much<br />
I can&#8217;t believe that the feeling we had is in the past<br />
I want a new beginning</p>
<p>Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born<br />
But we only see clouds<br />
We built up memories for ourselves<br />
Which we then destroyed</p>
<p>Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born<br />
But we only see clouds<br />
We built up memories for ourselves<br />
Which we then destroyed</p>
<p>I believed in your love, I hoped it wouldn&#8217;t dry up<br />
I believed in big dreams, but you chose to vanish<br />
I couldn&#8217;t believe that the feeling we had was in the past<br />
I want a new beginning</p>
<p>Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born<br />
But we only see clouds<br />
We built up memories for ourselves<br />
Which we then destroyed</p>
<p>Between sun and rain, thousands of colours are born<br />
But we only see clouds<br />
We built up memories for ourselves<br />
Which we then destroyed<br />
