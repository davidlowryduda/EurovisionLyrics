Ah&#8230;</p>
<p>A blue sky sweeps away the storm<br />
Which darkened my heart<br />
And here you come with everything you stand for<br />
Discovering myself as I am</p>
<p>You are the light that crosses the universe<br />
You urge me to fly with you until the end</p>
<p>The hope of life ahead<br />
Which begins right now<br />
Let&#8217;s go without fear, shout that in the end love conquers all<br />
That now it&#8217;s you and I</p>
<p>You are the light that crosses the universe<br />
You urge me to fly, oh<br />
You are the light that crosses the universe<br />
You urge me to fly with you until the end, oh yeah<br />
With you until the end</p>
<p>You are the light that crosses the universe<br />
You urge me to fly, oh<br />
You are the light that crosses the universe<br />
You urge me to fly with you until the end, oh yeah<br />
With you until the end, oh yeah</p>
<p>With you until the end<br />
