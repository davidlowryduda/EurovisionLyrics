<p>(Glorious)</p>
<p>Do you know it&#8217;s time to let yourself go?<br />
Why don&#8217;t we just let it show?<br />
Tell me what you&#8217;re waiting for</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I, I wanna live before I die<br />
Crash and burn and lose my mind<br />
We can set the world on fire</p>
<p>Tonight we can be glorious<br />
We are young at heart and we&#8217;re free<br />
The world is ours, I can feel the music in me<br />
Glorious, found a love that eyes cannot see<br />
Delirious</p>
<p>Now&#8217;s the time, we&#8217;re running at the speed of light<br />
I&#8217;ll meet you on the other side<br />
Every time I close my eyes</p>
<p>Tonight we can be glorious<br />
We are young at heart and we&#8217;re free<br />
The world is ours, I can feel the music in me<br />
Glorious, found a love that eyes cannot see<br />
Delirious, I can feel the music in me</p>
<p>(Glorious) Found a love that eyes cannot see<br />
(Glorious) (We are young, oh oh, oh oh oh)<br />
(We are young, oh oh, oh oh oh)<br />
(We are young, oh oh, oh oh oh)<br />
(We are young, oh oh, oh oh oh)</p>
<p>Tonight we can be glorious<br />
We are young at heart and we&#8217;re free<br />
The world is ours, I can feel the music in me<br />
Glorious, found a love that eyes cannot see<br />
Delirious, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh</p>
