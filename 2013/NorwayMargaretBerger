<p>A cocoon in a silent tree<br />
Through the dark night you listen to me<br />
When I whisper broken words in your ear</p>
<p>And you push, you push me hard to the surface<br />
Iâ€™m blinded at heart, but you wake me<br />
You wake me up from the snow where I was born</p>
<p>Now I can see<br />
The whole world is mine<br />
I can touch and feel<br />
I feed you my love</p>
<p>You put a knife against my back<br />
And you dare me to face the attack<br />
You say, &#8220;For cowards there&#8217;s no reward&#8221;<br />
Feel the heat</p>
<p>Take my hand, I trust your word<br />
Bring the fire, I don&#8217;t care if it hurts<br />
I have the future on my tongue<br />
Give me a kiss</p>
<p>Now I can see<br />
The whole world is mine<br />
I can touch and feel<br />
So I feed you my love</p>
<p>You put a knife against my back<br />
And you dare me to face the attack<br />
You say, &#8220;For cowards there&#8217;s no reward&#8221;<br />
I have the future on my tongue</p>
<p>Now I can see<br />
The whole world is mine<br />
I can touch and feel<br />
So I feed you my love</p>
<p>Feed you my love<br />
So I feed you my love</p>
