<p>I have to tell you something, it&#8217;s been on my mind so long<br />
I&#8217;ve got to tell you this, it&#8217;s been on my mind way too long<br />
I promised myself to tell<br />
Instead I&#8217;m falling apart to see you here</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m in love with you<br />
When summertime falls it becomes untrue<br />
Because of the shoes I&#8217;m wearing today<br />
One is called (Love, love, love), the other is Pain<br />
(Yeah&#8230;) Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>So tell me now (So tell me now)<br />
I&#8217;m in your head (I&#8217;m in your head)<br />
I&#8217;m in your heart (I&#8217;m in your heart)<br />
Tell me now (Tell me now)</p>
<p>Tell me now<br />
Because I&#8217;m falling apart to see you here</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m in love with you<br />
When summertime falls it becomes untrue<br />
Because of the shoes I&#8217;m wearing today<br />
One is called Love (Love, love, love), the other is Pain</p>
<p>But still you don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m in love with you<br />
When summertime falls it becomes untrue<br />
Because of the shoes I&#8217;m wearing today<br />
One is called Love (Love, love, love), the other is Pain<br />
One is called Love, the other is Pain</p>
