<p>Should have seen it coming when I saw you<br />
Should have had the sense to stop and walk away<br />
It was gonna turn out complicated<br />
We&#8217;ve hit overload, about to explode</p>
<p>If love was a mountain<br />
I&#8217;d climb up to the highest of them all<br />
I&#8217;d swim across the ocean if you&#8217;d call<br />
I&#8217;m lost in your smile, free-falling for miles</p>
<p>Hold me, just unfold me<br />
Unchain my soul, give me love, make me whole<br />
Hold me if it&#8217;s only<br />
For this moment in time, now I&#8217;m yours and you&#8217;re mine<br />
So hold me</p>
<p>Take a little time and you&#8217;ll know better<br />
Then to think about giving in on the one you love<br />
Here we&#8217;re going back and freeze the moment<br />
When we used to be free, was only you and me</p>
<p>Hold me, just unfold me<br />
Unchain my soul, give me love, make me whole<br />
Hold me if it&#8217;s only<br />
For this moment in time, now I&#8217;m yours and you&#8217;re mine</p>
<p>Remember how we used to laugh, but now you&#8217;re running from the past<br />
Let&#8217;s find the strength to carry on<br />
Remember how when love used to be, you said I was your fantasy<br />
Can&#8217;t take another night alone, so come on home</p>
<p>Hold me, just unfold me<br />
Unchain my soul, give me love, make me whole<br />
Hold me if it&#8217;s only<br />
For this moment in time, now I&#8217;m yours and you&#8217;re mine</p>
<p>So hold me</p>
