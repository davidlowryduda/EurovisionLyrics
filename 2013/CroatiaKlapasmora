I don&#8217;t have gold to adorn you with<br />
Only these two arms to embrace your soul</p>
<p>Oh misery, you&#8217;re as hard as rock<br />
Oh misery, you&#8217;re like two drops of wine<br />
I have nothing, only faith<br />
And a little bit of pure love</p>
<p>Oh misery, you&#8217;re as hard as rock<br />
Oh misery, you&#8217;re like two drops of wine<br />
I have nothing, only faith<br />
And a little bit of pure love</p>
<p>Oh beautiful rose of mine, for you I will live<br />
And last piece of dried old bread I&#8217;ll share with you</p>
<p>Oh misery, you&#8217;re as hard as rock<br />
Oh misery, you&#8217;re like two drops of wine<br />
I have nothing, only faith<br />
And a little bit of pure love</p>
<p>Oh misery, you&#8217;re as hard as rock<br />
Oh misery, misery, misery</p>
<p>Oh misery, you&#8217;re as hard as rock<br />
Oh misery, you&#8217;re like two drops of wine<br />
I have nothing, only faith<br />
And a little bit of pure love</p>
<p>I have nothing, only faith<br />
And a little bit of pure love<br />
(Misery)<br />
