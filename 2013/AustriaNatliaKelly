<p>When hurt is all you&#8217;re feeling, your heart is slowly bleeding<br />
The only memories to hold on to<br />
When you almost stop believing, you&#8217;re cold, alone and freezing<br />
You think you&#8217;re lost and don&#8217;t know where to go<br />
Look up to the starlit sky, reignite the fire</p>
<p>You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky<br />
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes<br />
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky<br />
Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes<br />
Trust me, you will shine</p>
<p>Time is always healing and answers are revealing<br />
Sometimes they&#8217;re simply right before your eyes<br />
But when you&#8217;re down here kneeling there is no chance to see it<br />
You can when all these dark clouds disappear<br />
Look up to the starlit sky, reignite the fire</p>
<p>You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky<br />
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes<br />
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky<br />
Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes<br />
Trust me, you will shine</p>
<p>Still alive and breathing<br />
Still alive and breathing<br />
Still alive and breathing, still alive and breathing<br />
Still alive and breathing</p>
<p>You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky<br />
You will shine, I see the light in your eyes<br />
You will shine, shine and fight the shadows in the sky<br />
Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes</p>
<p>Oh, you will fly up high, the light is in your eyes<br />
Trust me, you will shine</p>
