<p>What if I could change the path of time?<br />
What if I had the power to decide?<br />
What if I could make us unified?<br />
If I, if I</p>
<p>What if we would open up the doors?<br />
What if we could help each other more?<br />
What if I could make you all believe?<br />
If we, if we</p>
<p>What if we all opened our arms?<br />
What if we came together as one?<br />
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?<br />
What if we chose to bury our guns?</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t we always reach out to those<br />
Who need us the most?</p>
<p>Together we can change the path of time<br />
Together we have power to decide<br />
The answer lies within our hearts and minds<br />
Together, together</p>
<p>Together we can make a better place<br />
On this little island in outer space<br />
Together we can change the world forever</p>
<p>What if we all opened our arms?<br />
What if we came together as one?<br />
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?<br />
What if we chose to bury our guns?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s unite and make a change<br />
Let&#8217;s unite around a new page<br />
Come on sinners, come on saints, have faith<br />
Why don&#8217;t we always reach out to those&#8230;</p>
<p>What if we all opened our arms?<br />
What if we came together as one?<br />
What if we aimed to stop the alarms?<br />
What if we chose to bury our guns?</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t we always reach out to those<br />
Who need us the most?</p>
