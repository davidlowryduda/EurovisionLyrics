<p>So the arrow shot right through her heart and rocked her to the core<br />
And she fell so deep like she had never fell so deep before<br />
But the pain was almost unbelievable<br />
When the end was near, she felt the fear alive</p>
<p>Waiting for the bitter pill<br />
Give me something I can feel<br />
&#8216;Cause love kills over and over<br />
Love kills over and over</p>
<p>Waiting for the bitter pill<br />
Something I can truly feel<br />
&#8216;Cause love kills over and over<br />
Love kills over and over again</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause he didn&#8217;t fight for life when he was up against the wall<br />
And he felt so scared for both of them even though they had it all<br />
There&#8217;s a lesson that you always have to learn<br />
Through the consequence of fire comes the burn</p>
<p>Waiting for the bitter pill<br />
Give me something I can feel<br />
&#8216;Cause love kills over and over<br />
Love kills over and over</p>
<p>Waiting for the bitter pill<br />
Something I can truly feel<br />
&#8216;Cause love kills over and over<br />
Love kills over and over again</p>
<p>One last, one last, one last breath for life<br />
Wonâ€™t you give me, give me hope tonight</p>
<p>Waiting for the bitter pill<br />
Give me something I can feel<br />
Love kills over and over<br />
Love kills over and over</p>
<p>Waiting for the bitter pill<br />
Something I can truly feel<br />
&#8216;Cause love kills over and over<br />
And love kills over and over again</p>
<p>Love kills over and over<br />
And love kills over and over again<br />
Love kills over and over<br />
And love kills over and over again</p>
