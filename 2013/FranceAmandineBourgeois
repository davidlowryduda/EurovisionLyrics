You knocked me out from the beginning<br />
I guess I kind of liked it<br />
Leather ties and silk hands</p>
<p>Who hurt you and in which port?<br />
Until the dawn blushes<br />
You cast me like a spell</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
From where you are losing yourself<br />
Have a good look behind you<br />
And it will be me</p>
<p>You made me cry a lot<br />
You can still see your mark on my neck<br />
I used to like exchanging skin</p>
<p>No limits, it&#8217;s a classic<br />
I used to like our toxic love<br />
The one that makes everything beautiful</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
From where you are losing yourself<br />
Have a good look behind you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
From where you are losing yourself<br />
Have a good look behind you<br />
And it will be me</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
You&#8217;re gonna run out of air<br />
Unless, unless<br />
We end up together</p>
<p>Unless we have to<br />
Give up on battles<br />
(I&#8217;m gonna give you hell)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
You&#8217;re gonna miss some air<br />
Unless, unless<br />
We end up together</p>
<p>Unless we have to<br />
Give up on battles<br />
(I&#8217;m gonna give you hell)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
You&#8217;re gonna miss some air<br />
Unless, unless<br />
We end up together</p>
<p>Unless we have to<br />
Give up</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna give you hell<br />
