Don&#8217;t be so drowsy with that eternal paper<br />
Don&#8217;t yawn from sleep or boredom<br />
I&#8217;m your wife and I eat out of your hand<br />
But I don&#8217;t eat from charity</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t look at me as if you think: &#8216;are you still alive?&#8217;<br />
Am I still that woman<br />
With whom you once &#8211; when was it again?<br />
Wanted to have that little adventure at all costs?</p>
<p>Be nice once again, just like then<br />
Ask me once again for a kiss<br />
Bring me roses again, blush again<br />
When you see me, just like then</p>
<p>Be nice and gallant once again<br />
Find me beautiful and charming again<br />
Then the world will be just like before<br />
A fairyland</p>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;re getting fat and your hair is turning grey<br />
But you still can flirt, believe me<br />
Ah, sometimes you act like a child, so silly<br />
Gruff and wanton by turn</p>
<p>Do you remember? Do you remember? Don&#8217;t say no now<br />
Do you remember, that you said then?<br />
The happiest couple, that&#8217;s the both of us<br />
My love, dearest darling, never ends</p>
<p>Be nice once again, just like then<br />
Ask me once again for a kiss<br />
Bring me roses again, blush again<br />
When you see me, just like then</p>
<p>Be nice and gallant once again<br />
Find me beautiful and charming again<br />
Then the world will be just like before<br />
A fairyland<br />
