Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?<br />
Where should my song accompany us today?<br />
To your herds, the little horses?<br />
There the valleys are immensely wide</p>
<p>Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?<br />
Where should my song accompany us today?<br />
To the green pasture, there in the moorland<br />
Where once I&#8217;ve kissed, at the time of roses</p>
<p>Today is a day only for both of us<br />
And you and me are carefree<br />
Who else sees the world as beautiful<br />
As beautiful as we see it?</p>
<p>Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?<br />
My song will truly accompany both of us<br />
And through the fields, the wide fields<br />
It sounds in the wind, how happy we are</p>
<p>Today is a day only for both of us<br />
And you and me are carefree<br />
Who else sees the world as beautiful<br />
As beautiful as we see it?</p>
<p>Where, little pony, do we want to ride to?<br />
My song will truly accompany both of us<br />
And through the fields, the wide fields<br />
Sounds for both of us, my herippihei<br />
