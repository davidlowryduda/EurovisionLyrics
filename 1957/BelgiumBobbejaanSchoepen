Along the streets, a tune is dancing and for a moment I stand still<br />
Where is that pretty tune all of a sudden coming from?<br />
It&#8217;s playing in the trees, frolicking in the wind<br />
It can&#8217;t be bridled, it&#8217;s soon becoming my friend</p>
<p>Along the streets, a tune is floating, it&#8217;s as if a sunbeam<br />
Is penetrating with that pretty tune into the most little portal</p>
<p>Tralalala tralala tralalala&#8230;<br />
Tralalala tralala tralalala&#8230;</p>
<p>Along the streets, a tune is dancing, it&#8217;s heard by young and old<br />
Oh, how such a simple tune can become indispensable so quickly<br />
It knocks on the windows, asks: &#8220;Let me in&#8221;<br />
I can easily whistle it, it makes me good-humoured</p>
<p>Along the streets, a tune is floating, it follows me everywhere<br />
And I hope that this pretty tune will always remain my friend</p>
<p>Tralalala tralala tralalala&#8230;<br />
Tralalala lalala tralalala&#8230;<br />
