If you like nature, lilacs and birdies<br />
Muscadet, fried foods and the beautiful adventure follow the water side<br />
You&#8217;ll see a ballroom where you could get drunk<br />
In Lisette&#8217;s clear eyes, on the pom-poms of a musette ball<br />
Before deciding in a kiss to dare everything</p>
<p>Like the water flows in the fountain, this song<br />
Is the song that girls and boys each sing their own way<br />
It will be in everybody&#8217;s hearts, that&#8217;s for sure<br />
It will be there forever – the song of the beautiful love</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s sing it again under the lilacs and lalala here and there<br />
It&#8217;s the beautiful love</p>
<p>However the autumn has come, the ballroom with closed shutters<br />
Doesn&#8217;t have lovers anymore, nobody comes when it&#8217;s time to dream along the water side<br />
It&#8217;s the ball of the dead leaves, which dance on the gravel<br />
And go from door to door, taken along by the wind<br />
Whirling by thousands, waiting for what? – For spring</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s sing it again under the lilacs and lalala here and there<br />
It&#8217;s the beautiful love, lhe beautiful love<br />
