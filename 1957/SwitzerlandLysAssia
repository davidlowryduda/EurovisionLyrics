The child that I was, where does she plays today?<br />
Flowers I used to love, who picked them for me?<br />
My heart, do you remember the white dresses<br />
On the losing ways of our Sundays?</p>
<p>Words to sing a friend&#8217;s face<br />
Nights to dream, I was so rich<br />
When the heart on the watch, the straggling lock<br />
Goes to school, the child that I was</p>
<p>A winter time, wrinkle takes you<br />
A love time and we&#8217;re growing<br />
Much water had flowed under the bridges<br />
Forgotten dreams with the passing seasons</p>
<p>A smile time and we are in love<br />
Time to lie and yet we are old</p>
<p>The child that I was, where is he stray?<br />
Flowers I used to love, who had make them fade?<br />
My heart, do you remember our promises?<br />
Life didn&#8217;t want your tenderness</p>
<p>Words to love, hopes and nights<br />
Golden lies, I was so rich<br />
When the heart on the watch, love in head<br />
Going to the fair, the child that I was<br />
