Goodbye then, my lass, stay well<br />
I confess, my heart gives kind of a twinge<br />
While I&#8217;m kissing you now I love you<br />
But the ship is leaving tonight<br />
But the ship is leaving tonight</p>
<p>We met in fun, we courted a little<br />
But what was carelessness, suddenly became serious<br />
And you became everything to me, now there&#8217;s only you<br />
But the ship is leaving tonight<br />
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight</p>
<p>We&#8217;re making a plan, we&#8217;re dreaming a dream<br />
We&#8217;re fighting forward, despite head wind and current<br />
Towards what we want so badly then suddenly we see<br />
That the ship is leaving tonight<br />
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight</p>
<p>Evening in the sign of the new moon, two standing in the dark on the quay<br />
Girl and man, one from the sea, one from land<br />
Everything is said, now they&#8217;re just standing there<br />
In silence, finally she says:</p>
<p>Goodbye then, my friend, take care of yourself<br />
I think, you&#8217;ve been so nice and fair<br />
And I&#8217;ll be faithful to you, my life became the two of us<br />
But the ship is leaving tonight<br />
But the ship is leaving tonight</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m yours, with mind and body<br />
And now I can make a fuss and resist<br />
Against what I know will happen and cry and beg<br />
For the ship is leaving tonight<br />
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight</p>
<p>Suddenly the world stops<br />
You hear the signal bell sounding<br />
Your hopes lie broken, every single one<br />
We humans mean so little</p>
<p>The happiness, we think is firm and solid<br />
It&#8217;s only on an indefinite shore leave<br />
For everything, we own, must go, we think, it is ours<br />
But the ship is leaving tonight<br />
Yes, the ship is leaving tonight<br />
