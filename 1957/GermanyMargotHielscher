Hello &#8211; how do you do? Hello &#8211; thank you very much<br />
That&#8217;s what I hear from every country<br />
Hello &#8211; thanks, yes, yes, hello &#8211; nothing for me<br />
My heart is already taken, no sir</p>
<p>Telephone, telephone, whenever your call is heard<br />
At the very first ring I ask myself, what news you&#8217;ll bring<br />
Telephone, telephone, time goes by silently<br />
I&#8217;ve been waiting a long long time, yesterday and also today</p>
<p>You know my great desire for the most beautiful thing in the world<br />
Which keeps my heart and my soul breathing, day and night<br />
Telephone, telephone, for a long time I&#8217;ve been alone<br />
Tell me, when will I be rewarded with happiness at last?</p>
<p>Hello &#8211; at last, darling, hello &#8211; what, tomorrow morning?<br />
Tell me, why don&#8217;t you come tonight?<br />
Hello &#8211; don&#8217;t hang up yet, hello &#8211; I&#8217;m alone<br />
And I&#8217;ve been thinking about you the whole day</p>
<p>Telephone, telephone, whenever your call is heard<br />
At the very first ring I ask myself, what news you&#8217;ll bring<br />
Telephone, telephone, time goes by silently<br />
I&#8217;ve been waiting a long long time, yesterday and also today</p>
<p>You know my great desire for the most beautiful thing in the world<br />
Which keeps my heart and my soul breathing, day and night<br />
Telephone, telephone, for a long time I&#8217;ve been alone<br />
Tell me, when will I be rewarded with happiness at last?</p>
<p>Hello? Oh, I can&#8217;t talk anymore<br />
My song is ending &#8211; goodbye, good night<br />
