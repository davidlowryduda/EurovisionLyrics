You, that I love, you made me so much sad<br />
But how to erase the passing days?<br />
So much sadness, whole days long I&#8217;m hanging around<br />
Begging to my remembrance, a little bit from you</p>
<p>Your voice in a dream, I remember<br />
Whispered unremittingly, didn&#8217;t ask nothing<br />
You were so tender this summer night<br />
How to forbid myself to not listen?</p>
<p>You, that I love, you made me so much sad<br />
But how to erase the passing days?<br />
Nobody any more and my monotonous life<br />
Is marking out every days without your love</p>
<p>Without you I&#8217;m shivering, looking for your hand<br />
In the autumn night I&#8217;m hoping, in vain<br />
And nevertheless really my life inside of me<br />
Scream to me: I only love, only love you</p>
<p>You, that I love, you made me so much sad<br />
But how to erase the passing days?<br />
Your voice, your lips, imprisoned my fever<br />
But how to erase the passing days?<br />
