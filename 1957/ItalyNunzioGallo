She&#8217;s back<br />
The same things welcomed her<br />
The same roses welcomed her<br />
Sweet green eyed dream</p>
<p>She&#8217;s back, but it&#8217;s too late<br />
Too late for the one who waited</p>
<p>Strings of my guitar<br />
If my hand is trembling on a chord<br />
If music fades away<br />
In the indifference of a glance</p>
<p>Strings of my guitar<br />
Why do you stop, why don&#8217;t you play?<br />
Only you, for me</p>
<p>Ah, how sweet this music was<br />
Ah, and useless it seems now<br />
If she won&#8217;t listen to us, don&#8217;t stop<br />
Strings of my guitar, play for me</p>
<p>Strings of my guitar<br />
Why do you stop, why don&#8217;t you play?<br />
Only you, for me</p>
<p>Ah, how sweet this music was<br />
Ah, and useless it seems now<br />
If she won&#8217;t listen to us, don&#8217;t stop<br />
Strings of my guitar, play for me</p>
<p>Play, play<br />
Strings of my guitar<br />
