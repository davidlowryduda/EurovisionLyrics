You know when I am satisfied, then I have the whole world in my hands<br />
And I can hold the wind<br />
My soul is in storm<br />
When I can&#8217;t kiss you</p>
<p>If in the moment, I&#8217;m hurt<br />
I only want to think about you<br />
Then I&#8217;m not asking more<br />
Than your eyes can tell me</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make a necklace of amber for you and I&#8217;ll put my voice in it<br />
To sing a song<br />
When I&#8217;m far away<br />
Don&#8217;t worry about me</p>
<p>When I lose you of sight<br />
I&#8217;ll find you, because of your pearl necklace<br />
The voice of waves and clouds<br />
Calls me from far away</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m sad and crying I wish you&#8217;d come to me<br />
The necklace around your neck is wet<br />
If you leave me, I&#8217;ll take the necklace from you<br />
And its colour will fade</p>
<p>You know when I am satisfied, then I have the whole world in my hands<br />
And I can hold the wind<br />
My soul is in storm<br />
When I can&#8217;t kiss you</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m sad and crying I wish that you could run to me<br />
The necklace around your neck is wet<br />
If you leave me, I&#8217;ll take the necklace from you<br />
And its colour will fade</p>
<p>If you leave me, I&#8217;ll take the necklace from you<br />
And its colour will fade<br />
