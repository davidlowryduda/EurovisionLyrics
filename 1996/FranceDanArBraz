Come near, children<br />
Dusk and dawn<br />
Give me courage<br />
The future frightens me</p>
<p>The country people&#8217;s wisdom<br />
Warms up your hearts<br />
And the waking slopes<br />
On the lands around the black pond</p>
<p>May you blossom, children<br />
The hard fights and agreement<br />
You speak straight words</p>
<p>And so beautiful is your way<br />
To use the language<br />
That I miss, allas</p>
<p>May you blossom, children<br />
The yellow mountains<br />
With the nostalgia of the old celebrations<br />
Between your lips is the truth</p>
<p>May you blossom, children<br />
With your eyes wet from laughter<br />
And your sorrows silenced<br />
May you blossom, children</p>
<p>May you blossom, children<br />
The hard fights and agreement<br />
You speak straight words</p>
<p>And so beautiful is your way<br />
To use the language<br />
That I miss, allas<br />
