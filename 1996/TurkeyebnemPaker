My last door has closed, I have been hit without knowing<br />
Are you leaving me<br />
My branches are naked, my sky is darker<br />
Which autumn is today</p>
<p>Always the end, always hard, I got tired on the road<br />
You are there, I am here, look the years are in sorrow</p>
<p>I wish my days would wake up in the fifth season<br />
Come before the dream is over<br />
I wish my roses would open in the fifth season<br />
This much autumn is enough</p>

<p>I wish my dreams would wake up in the fifth season<br />
Come before the dream is over<br />
I wish I could hoist sails to the fifth season<br />
This much autumn is enough<br />
