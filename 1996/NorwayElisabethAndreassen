<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Day is turning to evening, is gone, soon forgotten<br />
But what we gave remains, a seed will grow and sprout</p>
<p>Such is love&#8217;s way when it strikes you and me<br />
Only when we learn and understand, it will ripen and be ours</p>
<p>Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years<br />
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity<br />
For eternity</p>
<p>The river smoothly flows, through meadows, plains and woods<br />
But on its way to reach its goal, it passes stony rapids</p>
<p>Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years<br />
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity<br />
For eternity</p>
<p>Though the days pass by, vanishing, becoming years<br />
Love will always remain, for ever and eternity<br />
For eternity</p>
<p>Love will always remain, for ever and eternity<br />
For eternity<br />
