Tonight my sweetheart, the half moon<br />
A cradle taking us to the sky<br />
Let&#8217;s leave the earth, and all its wounds</p>
<p>Let it wait till the dawn<br />
This night, my darling, is a night of love</p>
<p>Only for us, all the stars of the sky<br />
Turn into boats and fall into the ocean<br />
Make as many wishes as you want, guilt has no place in our night<br />
Live the thrills of joy, they&#8217;re only for us</p>
<p>Only for us</p>
<p>Only for us, all the stars of the sky<br />
Turn into boats and fall into the ocean<br />
Make as many wishes as you want, guilt has no place in our night<br />
Live the thrills of joy, they&#8217;re only for us</p>
<p>Only for us<br />
Only for us<br />
