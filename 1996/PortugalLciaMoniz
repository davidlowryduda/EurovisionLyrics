We all turn round the old circle<br />
Singing in this language of honey and salt<br />
What&#8217;s far away is still close in songs<br />
Throwing a tricontinental party</p>
<p>We dance the samba, the marrabenta too<br />
We weep the fado, and roll the coladeira<br />
Everyone is welcome through this open door<br />
If tired, say farewell to weariness</p>
<p>Go dance the corridinho<br />
Well commanded and whirling<br />
Shake the funaná, go deep into the malhão<br />
Because we will dance without restraint<br />
In the disconcert of this heart</p>
<p>And how are you? And how are you? And how are you?<br />
Gather round everyone, let&#8217;s all have a ball</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the mood, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Go melt your flavour with mine<br />
Set this song to sail<br />
For my heart has no colour</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the mood, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Go melt your flavour with mine<br />
Set this song to sail<br />
For my heart has no colour</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all whirling round<br />
Sweet laziness comes and goes<br />
In our mouth a rowdy craving<br />
For fig, papaya and guarana</p>
<p>We spin the vira and the merengue too<br />
We weep the morna, lose the zapateo<br />
Everyone is welcome through this open door<br />
Because people like to have a full home</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dance this bailinho<br />
Bring the accordion and the cavaquinho<br />
The chula will hop into the turn of the baião<br />
Because we will dance without restraint<br />
In the disconcert of this heart</p>
<p>And how are you? And how are yout? And how are you?<br />
Gather round everyone, let&#8217;s all have a ball</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the mood, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Go melt your flavour with mine<br />
Set this song to sail<br />
For my heart has no colour</p>
<p>We&#8217;re in the mood, let&#8217;s dance<br />
Go melt your flavour with mine<br />
Set this song to sail<br />
For my heart has no colour</p>
<p>Hey!<br />
(And turn around, turn around to finish)<br />
For my heart has no colour<br />
