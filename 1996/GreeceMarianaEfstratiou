<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
Sleep in my arms, and I will live in my summers<br />
As if they were beloved films<br />
Embrace my thoughts, and guess my words<br />
As if you knew everything I wanted to say</p>
<p>And everything we&#8217;ve been taught can just persist<br />
And everything we&#8217;ve been taught can just wait</p>
<p>We solve the difficult problems at night<br />
We find new lovers on Sundays<br />
We wear spring clothes in winter time, winter time</p>
<p>Put your head on my shoulder, make my fears go away<br />
As if you were a special trick<br />
Paint the day that is coming, and put on the radio<br />
A song about love</p>
<p>And everything we&#8217;ve been taught can just persist<br />
And everything we&#8217;ve been taught can just wait</p>
<p>We solve the difficult problems at night<br />
We find new lovers on Sundays<br />
We wear spring clothes in winter time, winter time</p>
<p>We solve the difficult problems at night<br />
We find new lovers on Sundays<br />
We wear spring clothes in winter time, winter time<br />
