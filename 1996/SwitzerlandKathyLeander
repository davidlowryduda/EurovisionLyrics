Alone today, I watch my life<br />
Passing by to the rhythm of my nights<br />
Sometimes I feel selfish and lost<br />
Desperately sad</p>
<p>I told him that he had to go away<br />
Like a long battle that I wanted to win<br />
I thought it necessary to hold out, not to keep him<br />
Today tears fail me</p>
<p>My heart loves him, when I think of it<br />
I shouldn&#8217;t allow myself to go by appearance<br />
But even if he takes me far away<br />
I will give him my hand</p>
<p>He stole too many tears from me<br />
In exchange he left me his soul<br />
But I&#8217;ll wait for him to return<br />
To start everything over again</p>
<p>And I thought everything was all roses<br />
Like the blue of his magical gaze<br />
I only had to smile at him<br />
And lie to him to belong to him</p>
<p>I told him that he had to go away<br />
Like a long battle that I wanted to win<br />
I thought it necessary to hold out, not to keep him<br />
Today tears fail me</p>
<p>My heart loves him, when I think of it<br />
I shouldn&#8217;t allow myself to go by appearance<br />
But even if he takes me far away<br />
I will give him my hand</p>
<p>He stole too many tears from me<br />
In exchange he left me his soul<br />
But I&#8217;ll wait for him to return<br />
To start everything over again</p>
<p>My heart loves him, when I think of it<br />
I shouldn&#8217;t allow myself to go by appearance<br />
But even if he takes me far away<br />
I will give him my hand</p>
<p>He stole too many tears from me<br />
In exchange he left me his soul<br />
But I&#8217;ll wait for him to return<br />
To start everything over again</p>
<p>My heart loves him, when I think of it<br />
I shouldn&#8217;t allow myself to go by appearance<br />
But even if he takes me far away<br />
I will give him my hand<br />
