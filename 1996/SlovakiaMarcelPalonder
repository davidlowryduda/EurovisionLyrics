I know, I am not evil<br />
I miss one face, and a little hope<br />
I still believe in something, there are only few such things<br />
And I know, the love exists</p>
<p>The love is strong, it examines us<br />
If we know how to endure the story of passion<br />
Then love, please, help me, let me succeed and find you<br />
If I still have you</p>
<p>Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Protect each our tune<br />
Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Shine while dreams are wandering in the dark</p>
<p>Sometimes I am cruel<br />
As everyone having dreams, experienced long ago<br />
Only in forgetting, perhaps I shall purify me<br />
And I shall burn the shade in my soul</p>
<p>The love is strong, it examines us<br />
If we know how to endure the story of passion<br />
Then love, please, help me, let me succeed and find you<br />
If I still have you</p>
<p>Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Protect each our tune<br />
Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Shine while dreams are wandering in the&#8230;</p>
<p>Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Protect each our tune<br />
Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Shine while dreams are wandering in the&#8230;</p>
<p>Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Protect each our tune<br />
Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Shine while dreams are wandering in the&#8230;</p>
<p>Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Protect each our tune<br />
Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Shine while dreams are wandering in the&#8230;</p>
<p>Love protect us, till you have us<br />
Protect each our tune<br />
Love protect us, till you have us<br />
