<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I&#8217;d give it all, everything in the world, to have you beside me<br />
To have your arms around me, my love<br />
To have you wake me up in the morning with your warm lips<br />
To have your hands touch mine, stealing me away from dreams</p>
<p>The night is long when I&#8217;m without you<br />
And every day, as if I&#8217;m dying<br />
But I know I love you<br />
And will wait hundred years</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be without you, I know<br />
I&#8217;m living for only one day<br />
For only one night, made of dreams<br />
Only for our love, I live</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be without you, I know<br />
I&#8217;m living for only one day<br />
For only one night, made of dreams<br />
Only for our love, I live<br />
