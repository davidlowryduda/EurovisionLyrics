<p>I hear your voice on the wind<br />
And I hear you call out my name</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen my child,&#8221; you say to me<br />
&#8220;I am the voice of your history&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Be not afraid, come follow me&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Answer my call and I&#8217;ll set you free&#8221;</p>
<p>I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain<br />
I am the voice of your hunger and pain<br />
I am the voice that always is calling you<br />
I am the voice, I will remain</p>
<p>I am the voice in the fields when the summer&#8217;s gone<br />
The dance of the leaves when the autumn winds blow<br />
Ne&#8217;er do I sleep throughout all the cold winter long<br />
I am the force that in springtime will grow</p>
<p>I am the voice of the past that will always be<br />
Filled with my sorrows and blood in my fields<br />
I am the voice of the future<br />
Bring me your peace<br />
Bring me your peace and my wounds, they will heal</p>
<p>I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain<br />
I am the voice of your hunger and pain<br />
I am the voice that always is calling you<br />
I am the voice</p>
<p>I am the voice of the past that will always be<br />
I am the voice of your hunger and pain<br />
I am the voice of the future</p>
<p>I am the voice<br />
I am the voice<br />
I am the voice<br />
I am the voice</p>
