<p>Like a circle goin&#8217; round in my mind<br />
Forever searchin&#8217; an answer I can&#8217;t find<br />
Strange attraction &#8211; man, you weave it so well<br />
Pure fascination, I&#8217;m under your spell</p>
<p>Here I go again ignoring my senses<br />
Nothing stops this love, and only a fool will tell</p>
<p>In a woman&#8217;s heart a dream is for life any day<br />
In a woman&#8217;s heart together&#8217;s an evening prayer<br />
As I think of you I&#8217;m wonderin&#8217; what halved us apart<br />
There you go again forsakin&#8217; a woman&#8217;s heart</p>
<p>Once you promised, seemed so true and sincere<br />
Like rhymin&#8217; verses, sweet words rang in my ear<br />
It ain&#8217;t easy on tough moments like these<br />
No pride can save me, I&#8217;m down on my knees</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t free myself, I wasted my chances<br />
Knockin&#8217; on your door, just let me in, hear my plea</p>
<p>In a woman&#8217;s heart a dream is for life any day<br />
In a woman&#8217;s heart together&#8217;s an evening prayer<br />
As I think of you I&#8217;m hopin&#8217; once more for a start<br />
Every now and then you&#8217;re breakin&#8217; a woman&#8217;s heart</p>
<p>&#8216;Cause I know you&#8217;re leavin&#8217; (I know you&#8217;re leavin&#8217;)<br />
Mmm, out of a woman&#8217;s heart<br />
Just keep right on heavin&#8217;, beatin&#8217; for love that fell apart<br />
Woman&#8217;s heart</p>
<p>Ooh, whooh<br />
There you go again<br />
Woman&#8217;s heart</p>
<p>In a woman&#8217;s heart a dream is for life any day<br />
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (In a woman&#8217;s heart)<br />
As I think of you I&#8217;m hopin&#8217; once more for a start<br />
Every now and then you&#8217;re breakin&#8217; a woman&#8217;s heart, heart, heart</p>
<p>(In a woman&#8217;s heart) Woman, woman<br />
(In a woman&#8217;s heart) Woman&#8217;s heart</p>
