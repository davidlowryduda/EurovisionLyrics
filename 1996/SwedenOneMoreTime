The winter is lowering its veil and is tucking in the houses<br />
The fire in the tavern warms us and the food and the jugs</p>
<p>There he dances with the wild one<br />
They are dancing like whirls in a waterfall<br />
Filled with pride and willpower<br />
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall</p>
<p>But rumours are spreading among the cottages while snowflakes are falling<br />
The stars are sparkling against the ice like clear crystals</p>
<p>There he runs away with the wild one<br />
They are rushing like whirls in a waterfall<br />
Filled with pride and willpower<br />
Rushing like whirls in a waterfall</p>
<p>(Wild&#8230; wild&#8230; wild&#8230;)</p>
<p>The carriage is disappearing in the night<br />
And the snow becomes snowdrifts along the road<br />
The sound of hoofs are still echoing in the mountains<br />
Playing carefreely like a waterfall</p>
<p>The night is lowering its veil and erasing the traces<br />
Wherever they are, they&#8217;re strong like the stream in springtime</p>
<p>There he dances with the wild one<br />
They are dancing like whirls in a waterfall<br />
Filled with pride and willpower<br />
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall</p>
<p>Filled with pride and willpower<br />
Dancing like whirls in a waterfall</p>
<p>Ooh&#8230;<br />
