Look, how everything changes<br />
I feel that fear rules my life<br />
Every night, when I want to ask you something you hide your face again<br />
Do I have to live like this?</p>
<p>Take me where nobody will find me<br />
Then I&#8217;ll promise to love you<br />
Every night, when I want you you hide your face again<br />
Was it meant to be like this?</p>
<p>If so before you hurt me<br />
I want to know my sin<br />
Only once before I lose you<br />
I want to know my sin</p>
<p>Every night, when I want you<br />
You hide your face again<br />
It&#8217;s very hard for you to show it to me</p>
<p>Yes, yes, give me something<br />
(Before you hurt me)<br />
(I want to know my sin)<br />
Only once before you hurt me<br />
I want to know my sin</p>
<p>Only once before you hurt me<br />
I want to know my sin<br />
The last time before I lose you<br />
I want to know my sin</p>
<p>My sin<br />
