I wanted to find your footprints under your feet<br />
I wanted to look at the sky and be<br />
A horizon of stars and sea<br />
And sail along those coral seas</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll search there where my dreams may come true<br />
To be bound with your hair</p>
<p>(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey<br />
(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey</p>
<p>(Among the foam to be) salt in the wide sea<br />
(Making of your look) echoes of paradise<br />
(Among the foam to be) bound inside of you, echoes of love<br />
A verse and a flower, oh, a verse and a flower</p>
<p>(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey<br />
(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey</p>
<p>I wanted to find your footprints under your feet<br />
I wanted to look at the sky and be<br />
A horizon of stars and sea<br />
And sail along those coral seas</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll search there where my dreams may come true<br />
To be bound with your hair</p>
<p>(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey<br />
(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey</p>
<p>(Oh, what desire) causes your skin<br />
(I follow your footprints) of caramel and honey<br />
(Oh, what desire,) oh, yeah, yeah<br />
