<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
I admit it all to you<br />
Everything is meaningless without you<br />
And while the cold rain falls down onto the city<br />
Who knows where you are?</p>
<p>Ayaya yayayaya&#8230; you are my love<br />
These are merciless times<br />
You&#8217;re a wild river on my path<br />
Yet I love you still</p>
<p>The sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy<br />
Give me strength, oh divine love<br />
The sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy<br />
Give me strength, oh divine love</p>
<p>I live for us<br />
The earth carries my voice<br />
To the depths of your soul, for that&#8217;s my home<br />
Yet I love you still</p>
<p>Hey&#8230; the sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy<br />
Give me strength, oh divine love<br />
The sun travels to the sea, my heart is going crazy<br />
Give me strength (Oh divine love)</p>
<p>Give me strength, oh divine love<br />
