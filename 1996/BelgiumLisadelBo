(Na nanana nana&#8230;)<br />
(Na nana&#8230; na nana&#8230;)<br />
(Na nanana nana&#8230;)<br />
(Nanana nana na&#8230;)</p>
<p>You had plenty of charms<br />
Burning I knew what you did<br />
But my skin was longing for those wild hands<br />
I was just upset</p>
<p>Even though I saw you standing with others<br />
Even though you ran off with them<br />
I wanted to and would get you, run you through with my sword<br />
Although I was playing with fire</p>
<p>Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers<br />
Love is a match of giving and taking<br />
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings<br />
Love is a game of chance for winners just like you</p>
<p>Passion won from tenderness<br />
Fury from cosiness<br />
Did you want to devour me without committing yourself?<br />
You&#8217;ll never get rid of me again</p>
<p>Even though you like to go your own way<br />
Leaving you doesn&#8217;t scare me anymore<br />
I want to and will get you, run you through with my sword<br />
Although I&#8217;m still playing with fire</p>
<p>Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers<br />
Love is a match of giving and taking<br />
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings<br />
Love is a game of chance for winners just like you</p>
<p>You and me, you or me<br />
You with that what&#8217;s-her-name, it&#8217;s enough<br />
Don&#8217;t you play, do you play?<br />
Play your game, you&#8217;re the king of hearts</p>
<p>Love is a cardgame with jokers and pokers<br />
Love is a sparring game of giving and taking<br />
Love is a cardgame of queens and kings<br />
Love is a game of chance for winners just like us<br />
