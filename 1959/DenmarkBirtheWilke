If you love fully, you love entirely<br />
You&#8217;re no divided nature<br />
And you&#8217;re faithful, faithful to amour<br />
Then I want to be loved back<br />
Therefore listen to me, my friend</p>
<p>For ooh, I&#8217;d wish I were you<br />
Ooh, how I&#8217;d love me<br />
Pat my cheek and stroke my hair and give me sun and spring<br />
A thousand kisses and a thousand caresses I&#8217;d often grant myself</p>
<p>So ooh, I&#8217;d wish I were you<br />
Ooh, how I&#8217;d hug me<br />
What a whirl and what a life and what a perspective<br />
Yes, ooh, I&#8217;d wish I were you</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I ask you: if you walked the same path<br />
And if you met you in the play of the kisses, if, on the other hand, you were me<br />
When we are ninety, we&#8217;ll say: who&#8217;s who&#8217;s?<br />
Enchanting you, I sing like now: da doo da da dey da doo</p>
<p>So ooh, I&#8217;d wish I were you<br />
Ooh, but if one day, you ask me to marry you<br />
Then I&#8217;ll say: you know, it went as it should, then you&#8217;ll marry me<br />
So ooh, it was good that you were you</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I ask you: if you walked the same path<br />
And if you met you in the play of the kisses, if, on the other hand, you were me<br />
When we are ninety, we&#8217;ll say: who&#8217;s who&#8217;s?<br />
Enchanting you, I sing like now: da doo da da dey da doo</p>
<p>So ooh, I&#8217;d wish I were you<br />
Ooh, but if one day, you ask me to marry you<br />
Then I&#8217;ll say: you know, it went as it should, then you&#8217;ll marry me<br />
So ooh, it was good that you were you<br />
