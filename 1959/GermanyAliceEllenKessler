Today we want to be happy</p>
<p>Hello, boy, tonight the band is really good<br />
Hello, boy, and we&#8217;ve got music in our blood<br />
Have you got some time? Then come along, don&#8217;t say no<br />
The world is wonderful with the two of us</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why we want to dance, dance<br />
Without any break till tomorrow morning<br />
Always dancing, dancing to this melody</p>

And what all twenties like<br />

Without any break till tomorrow morning<br />
Always dancing, dancing to this melody</p>
<p>Hello, boy, we&#8217;ll leave all our worries at home<br />
Hello, boy, and we&#8217;ll have a really good dance<br />
Have you got some time? Then come along, don&#8217;t say no<br />
Today we both want to be happy<br />
