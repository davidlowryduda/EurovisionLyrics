Dear child, can&#8217;t you stay at home this evening<br />
Darkness has almost already fallen<br />
Please mother, you know we&#8217;re going to meet tonight<br />
You don&#8217;t want him to go by himself, do you?</p>
<p>If he has to wait a second for his friend<br />
He goes straight home and never comes back</p>
<p>Augustin never waits for a girl who&#8217;s in love<br />
He is young, he is the king, he&#8217;s handsome and popular<br />
Hold my hat, where are the shoes? Get the brooch in my jewellery box<br />
Soon I&#8217;ll be meeting Augustin</p>
<p>Dear mother, please don&#8217;t stay up and wait for me<br />
Soon I&#8217;ll be turning twenty-two<br />
I won&#8217;t be as late as I was the night before<br />
Oh, now I must hurry</p>
<p>If I run quickly, I&#8217;ll make it on time<br />
Oh, there&#8217;s a run in my stocking, and it had to be just now</p>
<p>Augustin never waits for a girl who&#8217;s in love<br />
He is young, he is the king, he&#8217;s handsome and popular<br />
Will he now go away and whistle at Kristin instead?<br />
Or are you waiting for me, Augustin?</p>
<p>With surprise and worry he waits in the moonlight<br />
What kind of nonchalance is this?<br />
He&#8217;s never had the intention to wait for a girl that&#8217;s late<br />
No, he&#8217;d rather give somebody else a chance</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s how life is: What you don&#8217;t get<br />
Is exactly what you want, if you understand my drift</p>
<p>Augustin had to wait, until he was as much in love himself<br />
Even though he was young, even though he was a king, even though he was handsome and popular<br />
Yes, that&#8217;s what happens to someone who grows masculine too quickly<br />
And Augustin will never forget</p>
<p>And Augustin will never forget<br />
