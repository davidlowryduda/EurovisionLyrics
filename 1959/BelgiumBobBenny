More than fortune, more than power<br />
More than glory of fidelity and beauty<br />
Darling, I long to you</p>
<p>All my luck, all that I foster<br />
Lies in your hand, so white and so soft<br />
Darling, do grant me soon</p>
<p>Do love me as much as the flower loves sunshine<br />
Tenderly, because the sun opens its petals<br />
Do love me as much as the star loves darkness<br />
Eternally, because darkness makes it shine</p>
<p>Darling, do love me as much as the flame clings to the wood<br />
Intense, so the fire would blaze fiercer<br />
Offer me whole your heart in love and faithfulness<br />
Do love me as much as I love you</p>
<p>Do love me as much as the flower loves sunshine<br />
Tenderly, because the sun opens its petals<br />
Do love me as much as the star loves darkness<br />
Eternally, because darkness makes it shine</p>
<p>Darling, do love me as much as the flame clings to the wood<br />
Intense, so the fire would blaze fiercer<br />
Offer me whole your heart in love and faithfulness<br />
Do love me as much as I love you<br />
