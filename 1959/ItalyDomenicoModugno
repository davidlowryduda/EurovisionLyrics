A thousand violins, played by the wind<br />
All the rainbow&#8217;s colours<br />
Are going to stop a silver rain<br />
But it&#8217;s raining, it&#8217;s raining on our love</p>
<p>Bye, bye baby, one more kiss<br />
And then I&#8217;ll lose you forever<br />
Like a fairy tale love goes by<br />
Once upon a time it was here, then it isn&#8217;t anymore</p>
<p>What&#8217;s trembling on your little face?<br />
Is it rain or tears? Tell me what it is<br />
I&#8217;d like to find new words<br />
But it&#8217;s raining, it&#8217;s raining on our love</p>
<p>Goodbye, baby<br />
I love you so much that I could die<br />
Bye, bye</p>
<p>Bye, bye, baby, don&#8217;t turn back<br />
I can&#8217;t tell you to stay longer<br />
I&#8217;d like to find new words<br />
But it&#8217;s raining, it&#8217;s raining on our love<br />
</div>
