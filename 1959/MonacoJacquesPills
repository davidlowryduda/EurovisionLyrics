My poor Pierrot, you take your bow<br />
And your face is sad like your life of an artist<br />
You&#8217;re not loved anymore, your love songs<br />
Are too innocent, leave your velvet clothes behind</p>
<p>The public, with a cheer, decided your fate<br />
Must drag the curtain over your life<br />
The comedy has finished, your theatre is dead<br />
And your song ran away in the night</p>
<p>My poor Pierrot, my friend Pierrot<br />
About so much bad luck in the moonlight<br />
My friend Pierrot, a man of few words<br />
I really loved your writing, even when it was nothing but a sigh</p>
<p>If times have changed, old-fashioned harlequin<br />
I&#8217;m forever your friend<br />
As you have enchanted my most lovely years<br />
That&#8217;s why I tell you today</p>
<p>My friend Pierrot who takes his bow<br />
Who quits the scene<br />
Come and sing about your loves and your grief<br />
With me<br />
