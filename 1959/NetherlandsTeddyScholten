I wanted your heart to be a closet with a little door<br />
And that I could look in the little interior<br />
Then you had to be sincere, good or bad, but true<br />
And then you&#8217;d soon say, when I asked: &#8220;Are you faithful?&#8221;</p>
<p>A bit<br />
Everyone is in love at least once, you know that<br />
You want to be sensible, but you forget that<br />
As soon as you listen to what Amor whispers</p>
<p>Then you know<br />
It will be something like Faust and Gretchen<br />
With little rendezvous in a little caf√©<br />
And strolling in the moonshine</p>
<p>With smell of roses and kissing goodbye at the door<br />
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth<br />
I swear eternal allegiance to you</p>
<p>A bit<br />
You were in love more than once, mister, you know that<br />
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once<br />
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget<br />
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty</p>
<p>But actually, I&#8217;m happy that my heart has no door either<br />
Because you never know what may live there in the interior<br />
I&#8217;m willing to promise, when we get engaged<br />
And you ask: &#8220;Are you faithful?&#8221;, I&#8217;ll never say to you&#8230;</p>
<p>With smell of roses and kissing goodbye at the door<br />
The night is blue, you whisper mouth to mouth<br />
I swear eternal allegiance to you</p>
<p>A bit<br />
You were in love more than once, mister, you know that<br />
Your heart came up with a little idea more than once<br />
You were sorry, but ah you know, sometimes you forget<br />
Maybe a bit too soon, your little oath of loyalty<br />
