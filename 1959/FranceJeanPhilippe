Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes<br />
We&#8217;ll go round the world<br />
With my pretty threemaster<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</p>
<p>We will only have as friends<br />
The wandering breeze<br />
And the midday sun<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</p>
<p>Go, my ship, go<br />
Let your mast dance, let your sail flap<br />
Go, my ship, go<br />
For her and me, drift over there</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes<br />
Choose the most beautiful port of call<br />
And I offer you a paradise<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</p>
<p>Do you want the sky of Capri<br />
Or the palaces of Bengal<br />
Or the sun of Hawaii?<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</p>
<p>Go, my ship, go<br />
Let your mast dance, let your sail flap<br />
Go, my ship, go<br />
For her and me, yes, but look at that</p>
<p>My ship is very small<br />
It sleeps in a bottle<br />
And I dream as well<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes</p>
<p>When the night comes, we leave<br />
To discover thousand wonders<br />
Of which I don&#8217;t know the name<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no</p>
<p>Go, my ship, go<br />
Let your mast dance, let your sail flap<br />
Go, my ship, go<br />
For her and me, drift over there</p>
<p>Someday my pretty threemaster<br />
Will take me far from here<br />
In a wonderful land<br />
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes<br />
