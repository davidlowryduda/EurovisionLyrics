Who is he and what is the language that he speaks?<br />
Who is he? I wish that he would come close to me<br />
What is he? He spends the days walking his dog<br />
Who is he and where does he disappear to?</p>
<p>Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?<br />
He strokes the dog and I watch jealously<br />
There&#8217;s no sound in the park, I don&#8217;t see anyone<br />
Is this just a daydream or my imagination?</p>
<p>Is this a fantasy or just a sad story?<br />
He gets into a black car and I&#8217;m left alone again<br />
When I see the stop lights I hope in silence again<br />
That he finally had noticed a woman in love</p>
<p>(Time goes by, cheeks will dry)<br />
(Everything you touch turns to rust)<br />
(Tomorrow is a sound of yesterday)</p>
<p>Who is he and what brings him again to this park?<br />
What is the reason he gives tenderness to his pet?<br />
Who is he? I may never find this out<br />
What is this? Is this just a dream?</p>
<p>Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?<br />
Is this a fantasy or the beginning of a crush?<br />
He strokes the dog and I watch jealously<br />
There&#8217;s no sound in the park, I don&#8217;t see anyone<br />

<p>Is this a fantasy or just a sad story?<br />

When I see the stop lights I hope in silence again<br />

Finally noticed a woman in love<br />
