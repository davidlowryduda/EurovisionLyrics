She arrived alone with summer<br />
Came over and said hello<br />
Our looks said more than words</p>
<p>As if a star from the sky<br />
Had fallen into my hand<br />
I only knew that her name was Julie</p>
<p>Julie, Julie<br />
And I wanted that dream to last for long</p>
<p>I still remember the touch of that hand<br />
Her face and her subtle look at me<br />
I knew then that I love her madly</p>
<p>Like all the summer dreams<br />
The day took her away<br />
Only a memory of a July was left</p>
<p>Julie, Julie<br />
And I wanted that dream to last for long</p>
<p>At night, I ask the skies<br />
If that was only a dream<br />
Or if it was really Julie kissing me that night</p>
<p>Tonight I&#8217;m alone by the sea<br />
And the daylight had arrived<br />
I asked the sea to give me back Julie and July</p>
<p>Julie, oh&#8230; Julie, oh&#8230;<br />
Julie, oh&#8230; Julie<br />
And I wanted that dream to last for long<br />
Oh my Julie<br />
