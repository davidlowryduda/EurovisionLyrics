Living, living a day again, living a love again<br />
Living an awakening again, drunk, filled with sun<br />
Love, love like a fool, love, love on your knees<br />
Yes, even if you have to suffer, love, even if you have to leave</p>
<p>They said goodbye to each other, maybe till never<br />
But deep in their eyes, oh, how much they loved each other<br />
And the dance of the days will take them away<br />
To another forever, to eternity<br />
Far, far, so far away, like a star, a dot</p>
<p>Living, living a day again, living a love again<br />
Living an awakening again, drunk, filled with the sun<br />
Love, love like a fool, love, love on your knees<br />
Yes, even if you have to suffer, love, even if you have to leave</p>
<p>What do the seasons matter, what does the weather matter?<br />
Beyond the horizon, nothing is important<br />
They pass through the night deep in their eyes<br />
A shimmering flame, love as farewells<br />
Far, far, so far away, like a star, a dot</p>
<p>At sunrise, they took it away<br />
The guns of the killers will soon ring<br />
You&#8217;ve got to die in the end, they say, what do you want?<br />
Then he started to smile, he answered<br />
Far, far, so far away, like a star, a dot</p>
<p>Living, living a day again<br />
Living a love again<br />
Living (an awakening again)<br />
Oh, living (filled with the sun)<br />
Living, living<br />
