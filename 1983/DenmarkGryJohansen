<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
The planet&#8217;s spinning, everything grows again<br />
People meet, floating on a cloud</p>
<p>A rough sea in the mind of the soul<br />
An S.O.S. that makes me so blind<br />
Perhaps we could, between us<br />
Break the ties, do let me in</p>
<p>The planet&#8217;s spinning, everything grows again<br />
People meet, floating on a cloud</p>
<p>A shooting star leads the way<br />
For people like you and me<br />
A light is lit, and the night sees<br />
Once again, to laughing people</p>
<p>The planet&#8217;s spinning, everything grows again<br />
People meet, floating on a cloud</p>
<p>A thousand stars show the way<br />
The twinkle just for you and me<br />
You and me</p>
<p>The planet&#8217;s spinning, everything grows again<br />
People meet, floating on a cloud</p>
<p>The planet&#8217;s spinning, everything grows again<br />
People meet, floating on a cloud<br />
Floating on a cloud<br />
