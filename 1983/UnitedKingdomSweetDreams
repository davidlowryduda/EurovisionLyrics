<p>I don&#8217;t believe in idle gossip<br />
The jealous mind can be unfair<br />
I hear them make their accusations<br />
But baby, come what may, no matter what the people say</p>
<p>I&#8217;m never givin&#8217; up, not givin&#8217; in<br />
If there&#8217;s the slightest chance that I could win<br />
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war<br />
And get your lovin&#8217; back the way it was before</p>
<p>At times it&#8217;s hard to see the changes<br />
Or read the writing on the wall<br />
We may become the best of strangers<br />
But I&#8217;ll keep holding on until I know my chance has gone</p>
<p>I&#8217;m never givin&#8217; up, not givin&#8217; in<br />
If there&#8217;s the slightest chance that I could win<br />
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war<br />
And get your lovin&#8217; back the way it was before</p>
<p>Never givin&#8217; up, I&#8217;m never givin&#8217; up</p>
<p>I&#8217;m never givin&#8217; up, not givin&#8217; in<br />
If there&#8217;s the slightest chance that I could win<br />
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war<br />
And get your lovin&#8217; back the way it was</p>
<p>I&#8217;m never givin&#8217; up, not givin&#8217; in<br />
If there&#8217;s the slightest chance that I could win<br />
The battle may be lost, but I can win the war<br />
And get your lovin&#8217; back the way it was before</p>
<p>Never givin&#8217; up, I&#8217;m never givin&#8217; up<br />
(I&#8217;m allowed to&#8230; all I want to&#8230; need your lovin&#8217;)<br />
I&#8217;m never never givin&#8217;&#8230; never never givin&#8217;&#8230; never givin&#8217; up</p>
