You tell me about seas and ships, and my heart like a bird<br />
In your bosom hushes, and wherever you go, it follows you<br />
In your bosom hushes, and wherever you go, it follows you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close all the ports<br />
And the stations so that you won&#8217;t be lost from me<br />
Your mind I&#8217;ll imprison<br />
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer</p>
<p>Your mind I&#8217;ll imprison<br />
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer</p>
<p>You tell me about trains that keep leaving, and gypsies that move<br />
And I read your eyes, to see where they run, where they wander<br />
And I read your eyes, to see where they run, where they wander</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close all the ports<br />
And the stations so that you won&#8217;t be lost from me<br />
Your mind I&#8217;ll imprison<br />
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer</p>
<p>Your mind I&#8217;ll imprison<br />
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close all the ports<br />
And the stations so that you won&#8217;t be lost from me<br />
Your mind I&#8217;ll imprison<br />
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer</p>
<p>Your mind I&#8217;ll imprison<br />
So that you cease feeling nostalgia any longer<br />
