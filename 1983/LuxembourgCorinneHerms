<span class='GTTabs_titles'><b>Translation</b></span><br />
We, we were blue<br />
A summer sky, a transparent ocean<br />
We, we were two<br />
And when we loved each other, time stood still</p>
<p>But time betrayed us<br />
So why did you promise me the whole world?<br />
Our love would have been enough<br />
I didn&#8217;t want an imaginary happiness<br />
If life is a gift</p>
<p>If life is a gift<br />
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift<br />
Take love as a gift<br />
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift<br />
Happiness is too short</p>
<p>We, it was the child that I wanted<br />
To give it to you in springtime</p>
<p>But time has all the rights<br />
So why did you promise me the whole world<br />
And the child that isn&#8217;t there?<br />
Today is my only imaginary happiness<br />
If life is a gift</p>
<p>If life is a gift<br />
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift<br />
Take love as a gift<br />
Given gift, recovered gift, stolen gift<br />
Happiness is too short</p>
<p>(If life is a gift)<br />
