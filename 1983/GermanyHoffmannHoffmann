I can&#8217;t be alone<br />
With all these unanswered questions<br />
What did we both do wrong?</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t want to see any people<br />
The luck of the others still hurts me<br />
Why didn&#8217;t we wake up earlier?</p>
<p>We were like spoiled children<br />
Everyone only thought of himself</p>
<p>Consideration &#8211; nobody knew this word<br />
And leniency &#8211; which nobody found at the other<br />
And care &#8211; that never breaks what connected us</p>
<p>Insight &#8211; that everyone has his mistakes<br />
And far-sight &#8211; life doesn&#8217;t only take place today<br />
And caution &#8211; that you don&#8217;t break the other</p>
<p>Were we really just blind of love<br />
Or just too easygoing?<br />
Didn&#8217;t we notice what we were missing?</p>
<p>Perhaps everything was going much too fast for us<br />
Did only the night connect us?<br />
Didn&#8217;t we know that the day counts as well?</p>
<p>Did we lack the power to trust ourselves?<br />
Was it fear for honest feelings?</p>
<p>Consideration &#8211; nobody knew this word<br />
And leniency &#8211; which nobody found at the other<br />
And care &#8211; that never breaks what connected us</p>
<p>Insight &#8211; that everyone has his mistakes<br />
And far-sight &#8211; life doesn&#8217;t only take place today<br />
And caution &#8211; that you don&#8217;t break the other<br />
