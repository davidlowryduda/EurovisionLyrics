Stranger, what are you hiding from me in your dark eyes?<br />
A faint nuance of light somewhere, but still<br />
A stranger, that&#8217;s how I feel about you, I beg you, let me know<br />
Who do you want to be? Can you explain that to me?</p>
<p>Just like Mona Lisa has her smile<br />
You are hiding a secret too<br />
Stars, I see them, I would like to take one down for you</p>
<p>There beyond the sky is an eternity<br />
If you want to discover it here with me<br />
Take the first step and show me the way tonight</p>
<p>A feeling and I trust it<br />
Then our love will never be strange again</p>
<p>The night is there for you and me<br />
Forget what&#8217;s around us<br />
Let me come, let me be close to you</p>
<p>Just like Mona Lisa has her smile<br />
You are hiding a secret too<br />
Stars, I see them, I would like to take one down for you</p>
<p>There beyond the sky is an eternity<br />
If you want to discover it here with me<br />
Take the first step and show me the way tonight</p>
<p>A feeling and I trust it<br />
Then our love will never be strange again<br />
Then our love will never be strange again<br />
