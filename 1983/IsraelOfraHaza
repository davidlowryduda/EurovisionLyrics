<p>Listen, my brothers, I&#8217;m still alive<br />
And both my eyes still look into the light<br />
Many are my thorns, but also my flowers<br />
And I have countless years ahead of me</p>
<p>I ask and I pray<br />
Good thing hope is not yet lost</p>
<p>A song is passed from generation to generation<br />
Like a eternal spring<br />
I ask and I pray<br />
Good thing hope is not yet lost</p>
<p>Alive, alive, alive, yes, I&#8217;m still alive<br />
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad and today it&#8217;s me<br />
I&#8217;m still alive, alive, alive, the nation of Israel is alive<br />
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad and today it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>My days rumble (Alive, alive)<br />
As do my nights (Alive, alive)<br />
And in my skies, the pillar of fire still stands</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll sing forever (Alive, alive)<br />
I&#8217;ll reach out my hands (Alive, alive)<br />
To my friends from across the seas<br />
I ask and I pray, good thing hope is not yet lost</p>
<p>Alive, alive, alive, yes, I&#8217;m still alive<br />
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad and today it&#8217;s me<br />
I&#8217;m still alive, alive, alive, the nation of Israel is alive<br />
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad and today it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>Listen, my brothers, I&#8217;m still alive<br />
And both my eyes still look into the light<br />
So kudos to all my guests<br />
And to my sons who ask to return</p>
<p>I ask (I ask)<br />
And I pray (I pray)<br />
Good thing hope is not yet lost</p>
<p>Alive, alive, alive, yes, I&#8217;m still alive<br />
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad and today it&#8217;s me<br />
I&#8217;m still alive, alive, alive, the nation of Israel is alive<br />
This is the song that Grandpa sang yesterday to Dad and today it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>Alive, alive, alive<br />
I&#8217;m still alive, alive, alive<br />
