Good evening, when you arrive<br />
You&#8217;ll take away the winter and get rid of it<br />
You&#8217;ll have two arms, large like a forest<br />
And like the silence after the storm</p>
<p>For Lucia I look for the whitest sheet<br />
And then begin<br />
For example, I want to bind her hair<br />
With a wire of the wind</p>
<p>Lucia it&#8217;ll be the fullest moon<br />
But it won&#8217;t be enough<br />
To continue, I want a sea of wheat<br />
To cherish every few</p>
<p>Good night, when you die<br />
You&#8217;ll wear the stars and dream<br />
You&#8217;ll have a smooth sea for sailing<br />
And silence when you want to speak</p>
<p>For sensitive Lucia, I&#8217;ll be her shadow<br />
Drawn on the road<br />
For example, I want to open for her the doors<br />
That close the world</p>
<p>With Lucia I have enough<br />
She fills you up on the emptier days<br />
I want to give her so much again<br />
The smile on the face which is a little tired</p>
<p>Beyond the wall that is there<br />
Hold your breath and jump towards me<br />
Rifle shots are far away<br />
We&#8217;ll open the sky with our hands</p>
<p>For Lucia long life and the water of a river<br />
For every wound<br />
I want burning lights, the biggest feast<br />
For the whole country</p>
<p>For frightened Lucia, my pen<br />
Becomes a sword<br />
With Lucia at my side<br />
The story goes on to the next page<br />
