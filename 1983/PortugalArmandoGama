She says I was a very serious case<br />
But only I know that there&#8217;s something abnormal to that<br />
There was a time, a look, a smile, a beginning<br />
But now everything has lost its glow</p>
<p>In my life there was only one hug like yours<br />
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal<br />
It&#8217;s pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you<br />
It&#8217;s pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you</p>
<p>You might even think that I&#8217;m a bit sad<br />
But there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being this way<br />
For when everything is over<br />
A romance, a passionate amour or a way</p>
<p>In my life there was only one hug like yours<br />
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal<br />
It&#8217;s pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you<br />
It&#8217;s pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you</p>
<p>I wanted to write the most beautiful song in the world<br />
Looking back to see ourselves<br />
It was when I heard a bass voice singing<br />
This ballad which came from far away</p>
<p>In my life there was only one hug like yours<br />
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal</p>
<p>In my life there was only one hug like yours<br />
A dream, a book, an adventure without equal<br />
It&#8217;s pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you<br />
It&#8217;s pretty, pretty, this ballad that I give you<br />
