All alone with my pain<br />
I&#8217;m walking through the streets<br />
The loneliness of tomorrow<br />
Is getting me down today</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m waiting for the one<br />
But nobody is waiting for me<br />
I&#8217;m spinning right round in the twister<br />
Of stormy feelings</p>
<p>Such a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love<br />
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away</p>
<p>Then I finally found her<br />
After empty, dark hours<br />
But destiny was not on our side<br />
Now I&#8217;m standing in the rain</p>
<p>Such a hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love<br />
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love</p>
<p>I live in my fantasies<br />
And I hunt the rainbow<br />
Did we cheat ourselves?<br />
Cheat ourselves&#8230;</p>
<p>Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love<br />
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away</p>
<p>Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love<br />
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love is taking us away</p>
<p>Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love<br />
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane<br />
Thunderstorm of love<br />
