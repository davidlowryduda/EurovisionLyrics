Have you seen a cheerful man?<br />
Someone who thinks he has lots of charm?<br />
Don Juan of all times, calls himself Superman<br />
I should know, I&#8217;m married to him</p>
<p>He left home a Friday night<br />
Was going out for a walk and said goodbye<br />
But now I&#8217;m a bit doubtful, his suit and car are gone<br />
Can I take it all with a smile?</p>
<p>Because he is the great Casanova<br />
A great dancer, Don Juan of all times<br />
Yes, he is the great Casanova<br />
Top scores for style and charm</p>
