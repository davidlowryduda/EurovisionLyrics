<p>The sweetest thrill is knowing you&#8217;re wanted<br />
Never thought I&#8217;d feel it again<br />
So long ago, I almost forgot it<br />
It&#8217;s coming back like an old refrain</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be in love again<br />
That old familiar feeling when<br />
You say hello and you know it&#8217;s love</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be in love again<br />
That old familiar feeling when<br />
You meet your girl and the world stands still<br />
Your heart is filled with sweet melody<br />
It&#8217;s nice to be in love again</p>
<p>The sweetest thrill, I couldn&#8217;t believe it<br />
I hadn&#8217;t even a friend<br />
This heart of mine was thinking of leaving<br />
Until you came walking round that bend</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be in love again<br />
That old familiar feeling when you say hello<br />
And you know it&#8217;s love</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be in love again<br />
That old familiar feeling when<br />
You meet your girl and the world stands still<br />
Your heart is filled with sweet melody<br />
It&#8217;s nice to be in love again</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be in love again<br />
That old familiar feeling when<br />
You meet your girl and the world stands still<br />
Your heart is filled with sweet melody<br />
It&#8217;s nice to be in love again</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to be in love again<br />
That old familiar feeling when you say hello</p>
