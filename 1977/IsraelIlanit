<p>Yes, yes, it&#8217;s playing again<br />
An old refrain<br />
The was rewritten especially for you<br />
I shall sing it to you</p>
<p>And violins reply again<br />
Even I am like a string<br />
That was meant for one tune<br />
Your tune</p>
<p>The heavens will sing<br />
Love is a song for two<br />
The whole world laughs with me and sings<br />
How nice it is, how nice it is</p>
<p>The heavens will sing<br />
Love is a song for two<br />
For my song is your song</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it&#8217;s playing again<br />
An old refrain<br />
That we will sing today in a duet<br />
We will sing in a duet</p>
<p>For the song is not over<br />
It will always be sung<br />
Always</p>
<p>(The heavens will sing)<br />
(Love is a song for two)<br />
The whole world laughs with me and sings<br />
How nice it is, how nice it is</p>
<p>(The heavens will sing)<br />
It is rising and thumping like drums in the heart<br />
(Love is a song for two)<br />
With this tune</p>
<p>The whole world laughs with me and sings<br />
How nice it is, how nice it is</p>
<p>The heavens will sing<br />
Love is a song for two<br />
For your song is my song<br />
