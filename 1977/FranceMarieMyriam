Like a child with eyes full of light<br />
That sees the birds passing by in the distance<br />
Like the blue bird flying over the earth<br />
See how beautiful the world, the world is</p>
<p>Beautiful is the boat, dancing on the waves<br />
Wild of life, love and wind<br />
Beautiful is the song, coming from the waves<br />
Abandoned to the white sand</p>
<p>White is the innocent, the blood from the poet<br />
Who invents love by singing<br />
So that life gets dressed in feast<br />
And so that night changes to day</p>
<p>Day from a life when dawn breaks<br />
To wake up the town with heavy eyes<br />
When mornings gather the dreams<br />
To give us a world of love</p>
<p>Love, it&#8217;s you; love, it&#8217;s me<br />
The bird, it&#8217;s you; the child, it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just a girl of the shade<br />
That sees the evening star shining<br />
You, my star that forms a circle<br />
Come to light my dark sun</p>
<p>Dark are the misery, the men and the war<br />
Which believe that they hold the time&#8217;s reins<br />
The country of love doesn&#8217;t have a border<br />
For the ones who have a child&#8217;s heart</p>
<p>Like a child with eyes full of light<br />
That sees the birds passing by in the distance<br />
Like the blue bird flying over the earth<br />
We will find this world of love</p>
<p>Love, it&#8217;s you; love, it&#8217;s me<br />
The bird, it&#8217;s you; the child, it&#8217;s me</p>
<p>The bird, it&#8217;s you; the child, it&#8217;s me<br />
The bird, it&#8217;s you; the child, it&#8217;s me<br />
