Manana&#8230;<br />
Mana nana mana na&#8230;<br />
Mana nana mana&#8230;<br />
Mananana nina nana&#8230;</p>
<p>Lapponia, this is Lapponia<br />
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes</p>
<p>That girl is a witch, she creates with the power of destiny<br />
She&#8217;s without company and consolation<br />
And that&#8217;s why she conjures witching, she creates with the power of spells<br />
In the way of Seita she can beckon a man</p>
<p>Hei&#8230; manana&#8230;<br />
Mana nana mana na&#8230;<br />
Mana nana mana&#8230;<br />
Mananana nina nana&#8230;</p>
<p>Lapponia, this is Lapponia<br />
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes</p>
<p>A man left to the north, the road goes by listening to his instincts<br />
The man falls in love with the witch, he is a human being of Earth<br />
And that&#8217;s why the witch must go away, she&#8217;s the witch who flies<br />
She goes with the fire of the sky and the spells echo</p>
<p>Hei&#8230; manana&#8230;<br />
Mana nana mana na&#8230;<br />
Mana nana mana&#8230;<br />
Mananana nina nana&#8230;</p>
<p>Lapponia, this is Lapponia<br />
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes<br />
So sounds the calling song of the shaman:<br />
Mananana&#8230;</p>
<p>Ma&#8230; (Ma nanana nana nanana&#8230;)<br />
(Ma nananana nana nanana&#8230;)<br />
Ooh&#8230; (Ma nanana nana nanana&#8230;)<br />
(Ma nananana nana nanana&#8230;)</p>
<p>(Lapponia, Lapponia, Lapponia, Lapponia)</p>
<p>(Manana&#8230;)<br />
(Mana nana manana&#8230;)<br />
(Mana nana mana&#8230;)<br />
(Ma nana nanana&#8230;)</p>
<p>Lapponia, this is Lapponia<br />
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes<br />
Lapponia, this is Lapponia<br />
From where the call of the beautiful northern girl echoes</p>
<p>(Manana&#8230;)<br />
(Mana nana manana&#8230;)<br />
(Mana nana ma&#8230;)<br />
