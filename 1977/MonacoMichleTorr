I&#8217;m not Marilyn, I don&#8217;t like the night<br />
And in the magazines I don&#8217;t read my life<br />
I&#8217;m a provincial, I didn&#8217;t read Pascal<br />
I have a normal life, it&#8217;s almost original</p>
<p>A little Frenchwoman born in Provence<br />
When she was fifteen, she came to Paris<br />
Married the song, didn&#8217;t change her name<br />
And there she is, in front of you today</p>
<p>A little Frenchwoman born in Provence<br />
Ran away far from her children&#8217;s games<br />
Was she right to leave her home<br />
To be found in front of you today?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an idol who is loved and destroyed<br />
I always live my turbulent years far from Paris<br />
And without having a Rolls, I believe there&#8217;s no better<br />
When I see some kids playing around me</p>
<p>A little Frenchwoman born in Provence<br />
When she was fifteen, she came to Paris<br />
Married the song, didn&#8217;t change her name<br />
And there she is, in front of you today</p>
<p>A little Frenchwoman born in Provence<br />
Ran away far from her children&#8217;s games<br />
Was she right to leave her home<br />
To be found in front of you today?</p>
<p>A little Frenchwoman born in Provence<br />
When she was fifteen, she came to Paris<br />
Married the song, didn&#8217;t change her name<br />
And there she is, in front of you today<br />
