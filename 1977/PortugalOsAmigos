Portugal was the reason<br />
Why one day my brother died<br />
But it&#8217;s also a heart<br />
To beat in this song</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of whom I was born<br />
I didn&#8217;t find out who my father and mother are<br />
I just know I was born here and it was here<br />
Where I was a human being</p>
<p>Portugal was the reason<br />
Why one day my brother died<br />
But it&#8217;s also a heart<br />
To beat in this song</p>
<p>I say everything about myself<br />
Am I a child or a daisy?<br />
I hardly have what I give:<br />
A place nobody wants</p>
<p>At this country where I am<br />
I&#8217;ll do everything I want<br />
This homeland to which I gave myself<br />
Isn&#8217;t male or female</p>
<p>Portugal wants to give a hand to everybody<br />
And to be friends, to have bread<br />
Portugal will have the aim<br />
To end with longings</p>
<p>Portugal is already old enough<br />
For its people to understand freedom<br />
Portugal is the nation<br />
Where my brothers live</p>
<p>Portugal, oh my love<br />
The heart in my song<br />
Beat, beat heart<br />
To have a better life</p>
<p>Portugal, oh my love<br />
The heart in my song<br />
Beat, beat heart<br />
To have a better life</p>
<p>Portugal, oh my love<br />
The heart in my song<br />
Beat, beat heart<br />
To have a better life<br />
