When I left my house for a walk<br />
Thinking of my problems that I want to forget<br />
I found a girl sitting at my door<br />
Playing a banjo, singing without stopping</p>
<p>Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love<br />
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love</p>
<p>(La lala lala lalala&#8230;)<br />
(La lala lala lalala&#8230;)<br />
(La lala lala lalala&#8230;)<br />
(La lala&#8230;)</p>
<p>La lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lala&#8230;</p>
<p>I looked at her smile, and without knowing why<br />
Her face illuminated and she smiled as well<br />
&#8220;Sit by my side if you want to learn&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And don&#8217;t be ashamed, I&#8217;ll show you&#8221;</p>
<p>Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love<br />
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love</p>
<p>(La lala lala lalala&#8230;)<br />
(La lala lala lalala&#8230;)<br />
(La lala lala lalala&#8230;)<br />
(La lala&#8230;)</p>
<p>La lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lala lala lalala&#8230;<br />
La lala&#8230;</p>
<p>Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and I need to love</p>
<p>Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love<br />
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love</p>
<p>Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
That my heart is sad and that I need to love<br />
Teach me to sing, teach me to sing<br />
