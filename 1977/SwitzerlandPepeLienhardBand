She was rather slim, she was slim like a twig<br />
And sometimes he took her out of his closet<br />
There he played music and put his hand tenderly around her</p>
<p>He played rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll, he played Dixieland<br />
And was known as the One-Man-Mountain-Band<br />
He said: &#8220;only thanks to her is the world full of music&#8221;<br />
&#8220;She gives me everything and doesn&#8217;t forget me&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s my Swiss lady<br />
And I &#8211; a man from the mountains<br />
And who has ever heard her<br />
Will understand me for sure</p>
<p>Yes, she&#8217;s my Swiss lady<br />
And I &#8211; a man from the mountains<br />
And who has ever heard her<br />
Knows such an alphorn sounds so beautiful</p>
<p>Ja-u-u-uh&#8230; ja-u-u-uh&#8230;<br />
A-uh&#8230; Swiss Lady, a-uh&#8230; Swiss Lady<br />
A-uh&#8230;</p>
<p>When he came home, he took her by the arm<br />
Where he lovingly put her to pieces<br />
But before that, he played one time in Dixie style again</p>
<p>And in the deep of the night, when the people have woken up<br />
And complained, then he just laughed<br />
He said: &#8220;I&#8217;m inviting you and let&#8217;s celebrate&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Because my lady doesn&#8217;t want to sleep yet&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s my Swiss lady<br />
And I &#8211; a man from the mountains<br />
And who has ever heard her<br />
Will understand me for sure</p>
<p>Yes, she&#8217;s my Swiss lady<br />
And I &#8211; a man from the mountains<br />
And who has ever heard her<br />
Knows such an alphorn sounds so beautiful</p>
<p>Ja-u-u-uh&#8230; ja-u-u-uh&#8230;<br />
A-uh&#8230; Swiss Lady, a-uh&#8230; Swiss Lady<br />
A-uh&#8230;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s my Swiss lady<br />
And I &#8211; a man from the mountains<br />
And who has ever heard her<br />
Will understand me for sure</p>
<p>Yes, she&#8217;s my Swiss lady<br />
And I &#8211; a man from the mountains<br />
And who has ever heard her<br />
Knows such an alphorn sounds so beautiful<br />
