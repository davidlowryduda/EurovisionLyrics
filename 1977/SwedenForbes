The Beatles gave us their music<br />
&#8216;Yesterday&#8217;, how nice it was<br />
Everybody loved the melody<br />
Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>When records were released there was a commotion<br />
The gramophone played non-stop<br />
Everybody fell for the charm of the Beatles<br />
Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>A lot of people went around humming<br />
&#8216;A Hard Day&#8217;s Night&#8217;, although they were small<br />
Your great grandfather can tell you who they were<br />
The Beatles, The Beatles</p>
<p>The world was a big stage<br />
And there we stood in rows<br />
Enjoying every nice ballad<br />
Yeah yeah yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>The Beatles gave us their music<br />
Girls were screaming and shouting<br />
We still have all the records<br />
We shall remember Ringo Starr<br />
And George and Paul and John</p>
