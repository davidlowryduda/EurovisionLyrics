<p>Since you&#8217;re gone I&#8217;m all alone – Stop<br />
Just can&#8217;t make it on my own – Stop<br />
Operator, did you get the line?<br />
Rush a cable, for I&#8217;ve got no time</p>
<p>Gotta send a telegram, telegram to my baby<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m gonna send a telegram, telegram, and then maybe<br />
He won&#8217;t keep me yearnin&#8217;<br />
Tonight he&#8217;ll be on his way, tomorrow he&#8217;ll be here to stay<br />
Help me, ma&#8217;am, I can&#8217;t wait another day</p>
<p>Please forgive the things I said – Stop<br />
Didn&#8217;t mean to make you sad – Stop<br />
Operator, I&#8217;ll pay any rate<br />
If my message will not be too late</p>
<p>Gotta send a telegram, telegram to my baby<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m gonna send a telegram, telegram, and then maybe<br />
He won&#8217;t keep me yearnin&#8217;<br />
Tonight he&#8217;ll be on his way, tomorrow he&#8217;ll be here to stay<br />
Help me, ma&#8217;am, I can&#8217;t wait another day</p>
<p>I was such a fool to let him go<br />
Too proud to show that I love him so</p>
<p>Gotta send a telegram, telegram to my baby<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m gonna send a telegram, telegram, and then maybe<br />
He won&#8217;t keep me yearnin&#8217;<br />
Tonight he&#8217;ll be on his way, tomorrow he&#8217;ll be here to stay<br />
Help me, ma&#8217;am, gotta send a telegram</p>
