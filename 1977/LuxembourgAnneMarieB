(Brother John, Brother John)<br />
(Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping?)<br />
Brother John, Brother John<br />
Wake up, wake up</p>
<p>There is so much better to do<br />
Than playing my big brother<br />
I&#8217;m not a child anymore, you know</p>
<p>My little body has grown<br />
And I enrage to be a good girl<br />
When your friends want to kiss me</p>
<p>Peter &#8211; I&#8217;m scared, Harry &#8211; I laugh<br />
Pablo, Tino, Pedro &#8211; zero<br />
Simon &#8211; oh no, William &#8211; what a drama<br />
I shout, I bite and you sleep</p>
<p>Harold passes very close to me, and Pierre tightens me<br />
Eric, Patrick &#8211; it&#8217;s the panic<br />
Brother John, save me</p>
<p>(Brother John) In my dreams<br />
(Brother John) You take me with you<br />
(Are you sleeping?) In my night<br />
(Are you sleeping?) You flee me</p>
<p>Without you, I&#8217;d become a nun<br />
I can hear the bells ringing<br />
It&#8217;s my heartbeat when I wait for you</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve put some red on my lips<br />
And perfume on my fever<br />
But most of all, don&#8217;t sleep too long</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; mmm&#8230;</p>
<p>(Brother John) Brother John<br />
(Brother John) Brother John<br />
(Are you sleeping?) Wake up<br />
(Are you sleeping?) Wake up</p>
<p>(Brother John) Brother John<br />
(Brother John) Brother John<br />
Wake up, and come sleep with me<br />
